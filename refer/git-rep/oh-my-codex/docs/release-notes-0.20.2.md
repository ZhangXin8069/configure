# oh-my-codex 0.20.2 release notes

Release date: 2026-07-16

`0.20.2` is a patch release covering the exact frozen range `v0.20.1..f5e4753135ebc86342e7353300ac3ec5d9ae3d8d`. It contains 20 merged PRs, one release-development preparation commit, and the branch-plus-merge commits for #3129 release collateral.

## Highlights

- **Authenticated Ralplan bootstrap** — a fresh authenticated App leader can write Ralplan role intent during its first turn. Durable leader attestation, atomic tracker-locked intent publication, single-flight behavior, restart recovery, and subagent/provenance exclusion fail closed on ambiguity (#3184; issue #3181).
- **Native subagents and hooks** — App `spawn_agent` routing follows a surface-aware role contract; adapted-role tracker evidence and routing markers bind transactionally, recover after crashes, and clean abandoned cross-process lock artifacts (#3152, #3166; issue #3118). Recognized native children can stop without an auto-nudge (#3180).

> **Current status / supersession (ADR 3212; applies to the authority claims above):** Local leader attestation and adapted role intent no longer authorize. Typed routing/tracker evidence are lifecycle/diagnostic only. On `role_routing_unavailable` adapted Ralplan authority attempts, installed role-intent/preflight fails closed with `unsupported_documented_leader_proof`. Consensus is unavailable with `documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable` absent an official host receipt.
- **Provenance and notification correctness** — prompt session provenance is isolated between concurrent chats, fallback notification delivery deduplicates across processes, and canonical Ralplan ownership refuses ambiguous session aliases (#3168, #3165, #3158).
- **Setup, Team, and state safety** — setup persists explicit root-local `AGENTS.md` merge policy, Team validates and honors explicit worker policy before tmux startup, and foreign stale transition mirrors cannot alter current workflow state (#3164, #3136, #3172).

## Other fixes

- Workflow activation requires an explicit prompt-leading invocation, preventing accidental activation from quoted, negated, documented, malformed, fenced, or otherwise non-invocation text (#3140; issue #3133).
- Authenticated deep-interview terminal-state writes are accepted (#3179); foreign Codex hook coordinates remain preserved during setup/refresh/doctor/uninstall (#3151); BOM-prefixed state input is accepted (#3169); and detached panes retain tmux-owned terminal environment values (#3183; issue #3175).

## Dependencies and release collateral

- `actions/setup-node` changed from 6 to 7 (#3154), TypeScript from 6.0.3 to 7.0.2 (#3155), `@types/node` from 26.1.0 to 26.1.1 (#3156), and `@biomejs/biome` from 2.5.2 to 2.5.3 (#3157).
- #3129 reconciled 0.20.1 post-publish evidence. Both its direct branch commit and merge commit are included for complete range accounting but are not 0.20.2 product headlines. The version-development commit is likewise release preparation only.

## Compatibility

This patch release has no intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

## Validation status

Local build, lint, typecheck, full Node/Rust tests, packed-install smoke, independent review, `dev` and `main` candidate CI, all seven native builds, native-asset verification, GitHub release publication, npm provenance publication, and isolated public-registry install/CLI boot passed for the shipped candidate. The packed smoke used the exact Codex CLI 0.142.5 boundary. Full evidence is recorded in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.20.2.md`.
