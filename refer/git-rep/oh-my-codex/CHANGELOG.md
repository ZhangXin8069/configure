# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.4] - 2026-09-06

Patch release for the frozen range `v0.21.3..b08eceeecc7a7379f041ceca51260f073d8a95bb` (3 commits, 35 changed files, +364/−195; PRs #3615/#3618/#3622).

### Changed

- **Astra defaults across OMX agent tiers** — leaders, specialists, standard and fast agents, low-complexity workers, Team children, exact planning/research roles, new-agent configuration, subscription defaults, and SparkShell summaries now default to `gpt-6-astra`. Explicit model configuration, profiles, per-agent overrides, CLI/environment selections, provider-specific names, and established reasoning-effort defaults remain authoritative (#3622).

### Documentation

- **Agent catalog and workflow alignment** — the generated catalog now exposes only active/internal roles as directly invocable, documents merged and deprecated role replacements, and aligns the primary workflow wording with `$deep-interview` → `$ralplan` → `$ultragoal`; `$team` remains conditional parallel execution (#3618).

### Compatibility

- Patch release with no intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes. The Astra defaults apply only when no explicit model choice already exists.
- **Known gap:** #3623 remains open, separately owned, unmerged, and outside this release. On Codex CLI 0.153.4, doctor/setup still use the removed `plugin_hooks` feature flag for plugin-hook inference and generated configuration, causing misleading diagnostics and obsolete config. Native `hooks/list` recognized the installed plugin hooks in the report, so a runtime hook outage has not been demonstrated.

### Release train

- #3615 advanced synchronized package/plugin/Cargo development metadata to 0.21.4 after v0.21.3. It is included in the compare inventory but is not a separate user-facing headline.

## [0.21.3] - 2026-09-03

Patch release for `v0.21.2..3902573ef309e54534d7388579f2a7243ca7f465` (15 commits, 20 changed files, +1,285/−101, PRs #3604/#3605/#3606/#3608/#3610/#3612, linked issues #3609/#3611).

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Team wakes** — Team no longer re-wakes on already-terminal projections; terminal projections are retired instead of lingering (#3608).
- **Long responses lost from tmux scrollback** — the detached leader scrollback clamp was 500 lines, so long sessions discarded multi-line assistant responses from the pane while the session still held them (`/copy` returned the full text). The clamp is now 5000 lines with an `OMX_TMUX_HISTORY_LIMIT` override, range 500–200000, unparseable values falling back to the default (#3612, fixes #3611).

### Documentation

- **Composer drift triage and scrollback semantics** — `docs/troubleshooting.md` gains the prompt-drift symptom entry with the measured repro matrix and `tmux resize-pane` recovery, plus the note that `history-limit` is fixed at pane creation (#3610, documents #3609).

### Dependencies

- `@types/node` 26.2.0 → 26.4.0 (#3606), `zod` 4.4.3 → 4.5.2 (#3605), `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.10 → 2.5.11 (#3604).

## [0.21.2] - 2026-09-01

Patch release for `v0.21.1..04533ebfc887643586e37180ec3270473948115a` (11 commits, 29 files, +1,245/−10).

### Added

- **Optional GitGuardex HUD finish progress** — live review/autofix progress with project-root configuration, bounded stream discovery, and animation that advances at the one-second HUD watch cadence (#3601).
- **Bahasa Indonesia README** — Indonesian translation with synchronized localized language navigation (#3599).

### Fixed

- **macOS arm64 `omx-runtime` hydration** — global install/reinstall and immediate/deferred script-suppressed updates hydrate the verified versioned native cache, with bounded non-fatal network waits (#3602).

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-31

Patch release for `v0.21.0..abf2393af1e1f9355adfe43166432462a86d2e54` (125 commits, 116 changed files, +23,996/−1,141, 28 commit-subject references plus linked issues #3587/#3589).

### Added

- **Ralplan Advisory / Contract A** — cooperative Planner → Architect → Critic planning evidence without granting execution authority, installing a global tool fence, suppressing unrelated workflows, or automatically handing off to implementation (#3594).

### Changed

- **Trusted release publication** — tag publication is bound to `main` ancestry and exact SHA, native release assets are verified, npm uses trusted publishing, and the retired manual token path is unavailable (#3552, #3566, #3570, #3571, #3572).
- **Canonical state and process ownership** — state leases, locks, session pointers, and recovery distinguish exact process incarnations and preserve Windows/macOS durability and path semantics.

### Fixed

- **Detached HUD and session lifecycle** — exact owner-pane cleanup, refresh rendering, split and non-split tmux layout reconciliation, stable hook cleanup identity, and contention re-arming (#3577, #3578, #3584, #3587, #3588, #3595).
- **Team legacy HUD startup** — recognizes and safely removes both same-session-only and leader-only legacy HUD panes before topology freeze (#3597).
- **Plugin/cache/launcher provenance** — symlink, namespace, and stale launcher confusion fail closed (#3558, #3561).
- **Runtime and configuration reliability** — Ralph native-app deadlock recovery, SparkShell tail-line validation, empty hooks-state recovery, and generated configuration trust checks (#3589, #3590, #3592).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-22

Minor release for the exact 99-commit range `v0.20.5..0f2bbb704b83f94a69622b1915f555498e0dd283` (310 files, +31,779/−69,216). This is the post-epic consolidation train: deprecated skills are removed with migration stubs, hard workflow gates are replaced by advisory guidance, state becomes a single-source-of-truth with a read-only MCP surface, and `omx autopilot` returns as the canonical staged orchestrator. Consumers invoking removed skills or MCP writer tools receive explicit migration errors — this is an intentional breaking change with migration paths.

### Removed

- **Deprecated skills and prompts** — 25 removed skills now fail fast through a uniform sunset-stub resolver with direct replacements: `$ralph` → `$ultragoal` (`omx ralph` CLI and persistence runtime unaffected), `$ultrawork`/`$ecomode`/`$swarm` → `$team`, `$prometheus-strict` → `$plan`, `$review`/`$security-review` → `$code-review`, `$ask-claude`/`$ask-gemini` → `$ask`, `$deepsearch` → `$analyze`, `$frontend-ui-ux` → `$design`, `$visual-verdict`/`$web-clone` → `$visual-ralph`, `$help` → `$omx-setup`; `$tdd`, `$note`, `$trace`, and `$build-fix` removed without a direct replacement. Prompts `prometheus-strict-metis`, `momus`, `oracle`, `scholastic`, and `sisyphus-lite` and their agents are deregistered (#3506, #3502, #3508).
- **MCP state writer tools** — `state_write` and `state_clear` are removed from the MCP surface and now return explicit deprecation errors; durable writes route exclusively through the CLI/programmatic state operations (#3507, #3498).
- **Hard workflow gates** — the Autopilot/Ralplan consensus-receipt gate and the planning-gate requirement are removed; workflow transitions no longer require a host-issued consensus receipt (#3492).
- **Merged-away execution loops** — the standalone autopilot/pipeline loops are merged into the unified planning/execution surfaces (#3502, #3508).

### Added

- **`omx autopilot` canonical orchestrator** — first-class CLI command restoring the staged `$deep-interview` → `$ralplan` → `$ultragoal` orchestration as the canonical chain (#3518, #3517).
- **Ultragoal ordinary/strict modes** — the completion cohort gate is advisory in ordinary mode and strict in strict mode (#3500, #3505).
- **Upgrade fixture and drift tests** — a 0.20.x → 0.21 upgrade fixture plus generator `--check` surfaces are promoted into `npm test` (#3509).
- **Setup flags** — `--disable-hooks` (disable only OMX-owned hook registrations, preserving foreign hooks) and `omx doctor --repair-state` (archive stale state projections under `.omx/archive/`) (#3497, #3507).

### Changed

- **State single source of truth** — a sole-writer state model with read-only MCP projection, shared handoff-carrier invariants for every writer, explicit stale-projection retirement, and fail-closed handling of corrupt or laundered carriers (#3507, #3498 follow-ups).
- **Hooks simplified; PreToolUse advisory-only** — conductor PreToolUse write guards are replaced by advisory guidance with Codex App capability warnings (#3497, #3492).
- **Prompt architecture slimmed** — invariants are centralized and the prompt surface reduced (#3513).
- **Bounded plugin lifecycle** — plugin snapshots are bounded with a hook escape hatch, unpinned historical snapshots retired, and deprecated-skill retirement keyed to install badges (#3499, #3512).
- **Team worker provenance** — team workers on external OMX state roots are authorized through evidence-returning provenance verification shared by the native hook and `omx doctor --team` (#3537).
- **Session pointer authority split** — read semantics and write authority are separated on platforms without process-birth evidence; identity-indeterminate live pointers count as occupied evidence but never grant write authority, with bounded unproven-pointer adoption and verified-dead pointer quarantine (#3527, #3541, #3528).
- **Dependencies** — `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.6→2.5.8 (#3532) and `@types/node` 26.1.2→26.2.0 (#3485).

### Fixed

- **Detached `--madmax` root identity on macOS** — path-alias canonicalization, post-create root re-resolution, and path-alias-insensitive launch-context keys; regression-locked by #3550/#3551.
- **Detached tmux owner race** — post-tag owner mutation is retried under an unchanged authority fence (#3540, #3541).
- **macOS arm64 runtime hydration** — `omx-runtime` hydrates and is discovered on arm64 npm installs (#3519, #3520).
- **URL reader false truncation** — content at an exact size limit is no longer reported truncated (#3546).
- **Notification durations** — zero and invalid durations are handled (#3544).
- **Worker triggers** — submitted with tmux named `Enter` instead of raw `C-m`, with Claude 2.1.x prompt detection (#3531).
- **Team scale-down claim boundary** — synchronization coverage made load-tolerant (#3548, #3549).
- **Guarded tmux split receipts** — format-string injection is rejected (#3489).
- **Ralplan → Ultragoal handoff** — reachable via user-authorized execution handoff (#3463, #3483).
- **Conductor delegation lanes** — unblocked under typed, positively-supported native spawn surfaces (#3482).
- **HUD Fish parsing** — tmux parsing no longer breaks on Fish `export` (#3480).
- **Version display** — `OMX_VERSION_REVISION` takes precedence over `OMX_GIT_REVISION` (#3417).
- **Canonical contracts** — workflow and hook recovery contracts aligned (#3514, #3486).
## [0.20.5] - 2026-08-10

Patch release for the exact 68-commit range `v0.20.4..13c08f84cb6c27750b8f5c4a4d5105faad074196`. No intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

### Fixed

- **Darwin detached finalization** — bind readiness and metadata to live launch authority, tear down exact HUD/leader panes, and return control only after finalization (#3472).
- **Session and hook authority** — finalize exact indeterminate bindings, revalidate directory capabilities, expose trusted lock diagnostics, silence indeterminate Stop handling, and prevent authorization-failure reinjection (#3416, #3421, #3471, #3472).
- **Ralplan lifecycle and diagnostics** — preserve preflight state, report detected versions structurally, clear stale owner state, permit typed consensus delegation, and recognize Codex 0.148 alpha versions (#3450, #3455, #3456, #3473).
- **Windows/setup durability** — tolerate directory `fsync` and mode-synthesis platform differences while preserving user launch preferences and project scope (#3448, #3449, #3467, #3468).
- **Team/tmux boundaries** — explain foreign pane topology and preserve source-authority separator argv boundaries (#3434, #3460).
- **Plugin/runtime packaging** — make packed runtime/cwd checks deterministic, bind detached state to launch context, and validate native process identity readiness (#3395, #3436, #3454, #3461, #3470).

### Changed

- Updated `windows-sys` from 0.59 to 0.61.2, `tar-stream` from 2.2.0 to 3.2.0, `@types/tar-stream` from 2.2.3 to 3.1.4, `@biomejs/biome` from 2.5.4 to 2.5.6, and `@types/node` from 26.1.1 to 26.1.2 (#3429–#3432).

## [0.20.4] - 2026-07-28

Patch release for the reliability, workflow-safety, and native-hook trust work in `v0.20.3..73cb50c125c11aca0654b8841e690f011eb5f43f`, plus one additive, backward-compatible feature. No intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

### Added

- **Herdr lifecycle/status bridge** — opt-in Herdr lifecycle and status bridge (Phase 1) provides an external adaptation surface (#3241, #3242).

### Fixed

- **Autopilot host-receipt preflight** — fresh default Autopilot now fails before deep-interview and Architect/Critic review work when the official host consensus receipt verifier is deterministically unavailable, while preserving the exact fail-closed blocker, direct/manual Ralplan diagnostics, active-session resumability, and ADR 3194/3212 authority boundaries (#3270).
- **Native cache integrity boundary** — managed cache binaries without their `.sha256` sidecar are rejected; checksum verification establishes integrity, not a signature. On a retained hydration lock, confirm that no OMX hydration process is active for that cache key, remove only that named lock manually, then retry. SparkShell warns and falls back to raw command execution without summary support when its native sidecar is unavailable or GLIBC-incompatible. Binary and checksum sidecars are published as two files and are not an atomic pair; the lock protocol provides process-crash-safe, fail-closed publication, with manual retained-lock remediation, rather than recovery from a process crash (#3285).
- **Dead session-pointer lock recovery** — canonical session-pointer locks are recovered when positively dead, with identity-revalidated, no-clobber reversible claims; recovery checkpoints are resumable, swapped claims preserved, failed claims rolled back, and recovery directories atomically quarantined (#3261, #3262; issue #3256).
- **Team startup rollback and pane authority** — startup cleanup is bound to exact owned panes and split-proof reconciliation, pinned against ambiguous worker/HUD cleanup and PID reuse (#3265; #3231, #3228, #3229, #3230; issue #3224).
- **Team fail-closed on managed Codex bypass** — managed bypass rejection is enforced fail-closed when Codex bypass is rejected under managed mode (#3232).
- **Resumed session cancel ownership** — cancel ownership is reconciled for resumed sessions, preserving proven-session scoping (#3280, #3290, #3214).
- **Root session self-reopen prevention** — root sessions are prevented from self-reopening (#3284, #3289).
- **Native hook trust and path canonicalization** — exact absolute package CLI status is trusted (#3333; issues #3320, #3322, #3323, #3325, #3321, #3327), conductor mutation roots are canonicalized, macOS policy paths and temporary fixture roots are canonicalized, and planning state transport guards are repaired (#3343, #3344, #3348, #3349, #3350, #3351, #3352, #3353).
- **Identity-indeterminate pointer recovery** — bounded exact-match recovery resolves identity-indeterminate session pointers (#3324, #3332).
- **Ultragoal goal-status and state binding** — native Codex goal blocked status is preserved (#3301, #3305), aggregate goals are bound to canonical state paths (#3294, #3297), aggregate completion is persisted on ordinary final checkpoint (#3295), and finite Codex goal tools are authorized under Main-root Conductor (#3300, #3304).
- **State authoritative root and alias resolution** — verified native session aliases are resolved (#3308, #3160), and durable state commits are revalidated against exact stale session bindings (#3272, #3298).
- **Deep-interview cancel and self-lock** — the deep-interview omx cancel hook is made hook-owned (#3293, #3299), and the PreToolUse self-lock is fixed (#3240).
- **HUD teardown and resize guards** — detached HUD is torn down on child exit (#3267), and deferred HUD resize sinks are guarded in command-list context (#3292, #3296).
- **Native Stop hook bounds** — sloppy fallback Stop audit is bounded and session-scoped (#3347), native Stop hook pointer loops are bounded (#3238), paused Stop guidance is bounded (#3237), and unmatched native Stop is silenced (#3254).
- **Native sidecar and collaboration authority** — native sidecar session authority is scoped during pointer conflicts (#3244), live session pointers are prevented from native-start replacement (#3235), collaboration tool names are canonicalized (#3264), and collaboration.send_message is scoped out of native-child orchestration deny (#3317).
- **Standalone Conductor activation guard** — standalone Ultragoal Conductor activation with no reachable owner is refused (#3311, #3312).
- **Unauthoritative plan bootstrap rejection** — unauthoritative Ultragoal bootstrap publication is rejected (#3326).
- **Read-only discovery misclassification** — omx/gjc read-only discovery is no longer misclassified as writes (#3313, #3314, #3318).
- **Auth metadata validation and credential switch** — metadata is validated before credential switch (#3276).
- **Oversized native hook stdin** — oversized native hook stdin is drained (#3273).
- **Nonexistent native assignment guidance** — nonexistent native assignment guidance is removed (#3346).
- **Windows session owner PID** — Windows native hook session owner PID is resolved (#3260).
- **Bun install ownership** — Bun install ownership is preserved during update (#3259).
- **tmux separator argv boundaries** — tmux separator argv boundaries are preserved (#3258).
- **Ralplan preflight guidance** — Ralplan preflight guidance is scoped (#3255).

## [0.20.3] - 2026-07-19

Patch release for the reliability and workflow-safety work in `v0.20.2..f967cfed64ec57614af136f75d7cb81509808f7e`, plus one additive, backward-compatible feature. No intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

### Added

- **Max per-agent reasoning effort** — per-agent reasoning effort can be capped through the team model contract (#3143).

### Fixed

- **Team exact live-pane authority** — Team validates exact live tmux panes before applying explicit lifecycle effects, binds pane ownership through startup, scaling, rollback, recovery, and teardown, makes membership and scaling transactions durable and failure-atomic, and binds notify dispatch to the owning worker pane pid (#3153; issue #3121).
- **Ralplan review integrity** — Ralplan requires strict direct review order (#3186), fails closed without documented leader proof (#3196; issue #3194), attests the reconciled leader in `PreToolUse` to close the live-exec regression (#3187; issue #3181), and resolves the App leader-proof regression by parsing collaboration results structurally (#3218; issue #3204).

> **Current status / supersession (ADR 3212):** Local leader attestation and adapted role intent no longer authorize. Typed routing/tracker evidence are lifecycle/diagnostic only. On `role_routing_unavailable` adapted Ralplan authority attempts, installed role-intent/preflight fails closed with `unsupported_documented_leader_proof`. Consensus is unavailable with `documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable` absent an official host receipt.

- **Team mailbox and session recovery** — mailbox wakeups are coalesced and every wake is acknowledged (#3217; issue #3195), and exact session pointer lock recovery is added (#3215; issue #3203).
- **Native hook write identity** — native child write identity is hardened across the native hook, code-intel, and wiki MCP surfaces (#3135; issue #3127).
- **Configuration trust tables** — the config generator reconciles duplicate project trust tables idempotently (#3201; issue #3199).
- **Plugin hook responses** — the plugin native hook returns structured responses for oversized tool-hook payloads (#3211).
- **Windows durability** — regular-file `fsync` `EPERM` is tolerated on Windows across hooks, uninstall, and the native hook (#3191).
- **CLI documentation** — isolated standard launches are documented in the CLI and README (#3192).

### Release collateral

- `1c007fff`, `122b0cba`, `fb13a6db`, and `0a7baa81` are v0.20.2 post-publish evidence corrections carried forward; they are release-collateral inventory only.
- `4b557d13` began 0.20.3 development and synchronized version metadata; it is release preparation, not a product headline.

### PRs

- #3135, #3143, #3153, #3186, #3187, #3191, #3192, #3196, #3201, #3211, #3215, #3217, #3218. Associated issues #3121, #3127, #3181, #3194, #3195, #3199, #3203, and #3204 are not additional PRs.

### Verification

- Pre-tag gate requirements and receipt locations are declared in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.20.3.md`. This changelog asserts no CI run, tag, GitHub release, or npm publication result beyond what that record documents.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-07-16

Patch release for the reliability and workflow-safety work in `v0.20.1..f5e4753135ebc86342e7353300ac3ec5d9ae3d8d`. No intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

### Fixed

- **Authenticated Ralplan bootstrap** — a fresh authenticated App leader can create a Ralplan role intent in-turn, with durable leader attestation, atomic single-flight intent recording, recovery, and fail-closed subagent/provenance checks (#3184; issue #3181).
- **Native subagents and hooks** — App `spawn_agent` uses a surface-aware role contract; adapted role routing is transactionally bound to tracker evidence and markers, including crash recovery and cross-process lock-artifact cleanup (#3152, #3166; issue #3118). Recognized native subagents can stop without an unwanted automatic nudge (#3180).

> **Current status / supersession (ADR 3212; applies to the authority claims above):** Local leader attestation and adapted role intent no longer authorize. Typed routing/tracker evidence are lifecycle/diagnostic only. On `role_routing_unavailable` adapted Ralplan authority attempts, installed role-intent/preflight fails closed with `unsupported_documented_leader_proof`. Consensus is unavailable with `documented_host_consensus_receipt_unavailable` absent an official host receipt.
- **Workflow activation and terminal state** — workflow activation requires an explicit prompt-leading invocation, avoiding quoted, negated, documented, or malformed mentions (#3140; issue #3133); authenticated deep-interview terminal writes are accepted (#3179; issue #3177).
- **Session, state, and notification isolation** — prompt session provenance is isolated across concurrent chats (#3168), fallback notification delivery is deduplicated across processes (#3165; issue #3162), canonical Ralplan session ownership rejects ambiguous aliases (#3158), and foreign stale workflow-transition mirrors are ignored (#3172).
- **Setup and runtime environment** — setup persists an explicit root-local `AGENTS.md` merge policy across refreshes while retaining absence semantics and transient `--force` behavior (#3164; issue #3163); explicit Team worker policy is validated before tmux startup (#3136); detached panes retain their tmux-owned terminal environment (#3183; issue #3175); BOM-prefixed state input files are accepted (#3169).
- **Hook-coordinate ownership** — setup, refresh, doctor, and uninstall preserve foreign Codex hook coordinates rather than claiming or removing them (#3151).

### Changed

- Updated `actions/setup-node` from 6 to 7 (#3154), TypeScript from 6.0.3 to 7.0.2 (#3155), `@types/node` from 26.1.0 to 26.1.1 (#3156), and `@biomejs/biome` from 2.5.2 to 2.5.3 (#3157).

### Release collateral

- #3129 reconciled 0.20.1 post-publish evidence. Its direct branch commit (`c628486896ffa8b9188335b91a76192571e32c9d`) and merge commit (`fce27bfd6c17c7665a6f1505b6b8384cc2c8edd5`) are release-collateral inventory only.
- `29bdeb5c5670c133d9f2feda7512ee01e80a63d5` began 0.20.2 development and synchronized version metadata; it is release preparation, not a product headline.

### Verification

- Pre-tag gate requirements and receipt locations are declared in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.20.2.md`. This changelog asserts no local gate, review, CI run, tag, GitHub release, or npm publication result.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-12

Patch release for the reliability fixes in `v0.20.0..9eadab9f191103177fb3eac1b237188ada1f503c`. No intentional breaking CLI or package-layout changes.

### Fixed

- **CRLF AGENTS markers** — generated `AGENTS.md` marker insertion preserves CRLF line endings (#3107).
- **Ralplan drafts** — the native planning-write boundary permits normalized direct-child Markdown artifacts under `.omx/drafts/` while retaining its fail-closed protections (#3110).
- **Fresh configuration ownership** — setup no longer seeds legacy multi-agent or context-window defaults, preserving user-owned configuration and native role routing (#3111, #3115).
- **Stop hook protocol** — Stop responses no longer emit unsupported top-level fields and remain schema-safe (#3114).
- **Delegated child provenance** — the Conductor guard accepts trusted delegated collaboration children while continuing to protect leader and planning-boundary cases (#3117; issue #3116).
- **Native delegation and Bash targets** — native delegation detection distinguishes incomplete capability inventories, and quoted Bash argument values no longer masquerade as write redirects (#3120; issue #3119).

### Release collateral

- `f644d2cd3ae98587942aa94f0030f083ea0bb10f` and `5d43a5bf6f008de17f9425bee4495c457c60b96a` are prior-release documentation corrections carried forward from 0.20.0 collateral; they are not 0.20.1 product-fix headlines.

### PRs

- #3107, #3110, #3111, #3114, #3115, #3117, #3120. Issues #3116 and #3119 are associated issues, not additional PRs.

### Verification

- Pre-tag requirements, evidence schema, and pending external evidence are declared in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.20.1.md`; this changelog records no test, CI, tag, or publication result.
## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-10

Minor release migrating the entire model contract to OpenAI's GPT-5.6 generation (publicly released 2026-07-09), plus the accumulated dev-branch fixes and features merged since `0.19.1`.

### Added

- **Capabilities lockfile preflight** — new `omx capabilities lock`/`check` CLI providing a manual capabilities-lockfile preflight (#3087).
- **GPT-5.6 model aliases** — `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.6-sol` recognized as known Codex model aliases (#3104).
- **Canonical worktree tool context** — shared CodeGraph/worktree tool-context resolution (#3102).
- **Persisted subagents reopen on SessionStart** (#3099).

### Changed

- **Model contract migrated to GPT-5.6 (Sol/Terra/Luna)** — frontier default `gpt-5.5` -> `gpt-5.6-sol`, standard `gpt-5.4-mini` -> `gpt-5.6-terra`, spark `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` -> `gpt-5.6-luna` across runtime defaults, agent definitions, Rust crates (sparkshell/explore/api), docs, prompts, skills, plugin mirror, and test fixtures.
- **Role allocation on the new lanes** — planner/architect pinned to exact `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium/xhigh reasoning), researcher pinned to exact `gpt-5.6-terra`; standard worker/review roles use `gpt-5.6-terra`; fast/low-complexity roles and team low-complexity workers use `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- **Exact-model composition seam retargeted** — `EXACT_GPT_5_4_MINI_MODEL` renamed to `EXACT_GPT_5_6_TERRA_MODEL`; guidance keys off the trimmed final resolved model with exact case-sensitive equality and now takes precedence over role `exactModel` pins.
- **Setup legacy upgrade set widened** — setup offers prompt-gated upgrades from both `gpt-5.3-codex` and `gpt-5.5` to `gpt-5.6-sol`; declined and non-interactive runs preserve the existing model.
- **Autopilot cheap-lane classifier** — canonical `gpt-5.6-terra` and `gpt-5.6-luna` are classified as cheap ahead of the generic heuristic, so Terra mains route heavy planning to the dedicated planner.
- **Project setup defaults to plugin mode with plugin cache** (#3085); plugin hooks are gated to omx-launched sessions (#3086); resume plugin preflight is opt-in (#3088).

### Fixed

- **Team delegation child-model fallback** resolves through `getTeamChildModel()` (honors `OMX_TEAM_CHILD_MODEL`) instead of a hardcoded seam constant.
- **Doctor Spark source labeling** reports `.omx-config.json env` and `.omx-config.json models.team_low_complexity` accurately instead of misattributing sources.
- **Conductor deadlock without native subagents prevented** (#3079); resume `--sort updated` preserves transcript mtimes (#3080); plugin Stop hook accepts last-line JSON after launcher noise (#3082).
- **Deep-interview state hardening** — runtime state allowlist (#3091) and terminal-state normalization (#3092).
- **Ralplan/Ultragoal handoff fixes** — approval handoff and lane reuse (#3094), ralplan-handoff goal derivation guard (#3097), structured ultragoal steering cleanup (#3100).

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-08

Patch release after `0.19.0` focused on Ultragoal/Ralplan terminal-state reliability, direct Team state roots, mission queue execution, and dependency hygiene.

### Added

- Mission queue runner MVP (#3063).

### Fixed

- Repair Ultragoal conductor provenance and task-scoped aggregate completion state (#3074, #3072).
- Handle invalid mission summary JSON (#3070).
- Fix Ralplan terminalization tracker lag and terminal Stop cache loops (#3068, #3058).
- Fix state roots for direct Team state directory usage (#3062).

### Changed

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-04

Reliability and safety-hardening train after `0.18.17`: planning-gate and handoff-artifact execution transports are locked down, the conductor contract and typed subagent/lane provenance are hardened, Ralplan consensus/terminal-state handling is tightened, madmax worktree and resume paths are fixed, and a long-standing parallel-test flake in the Rust suite is eliminated. The CLI/package/plugin contract is preserved.

### Changed

- **Planning and handoff execution transports are locked down** — `.omx/tmp` planning artifacts, same-command handoff artifact scripts, and planning-guard Python/read-only-Bash writes can no longer be used as execution transports, while legitimate deep-interview→ralplan artifact handoff is still allowed.
- **Conductor and typed-lane contracts are hardened** — conductor contract, typed subagent provenance, typed-lane fences, shell-guard target parsing, and the conductor reuse ledger reduce unsafe or ambiguous delegation.

### Fixed

- **Test flakiness eliminated** — the Rust sparkshell test helper `unique_temp_dir()` now uses a per-process monotonic counter so parallel same-process tests can no longer collide on a shared temp state root, fixing intermittent `json_mode_reports_failed_worker_status` failures.
- **Ralplan consensus and terminal state are safer** — consensus review evidence, terminal closeout state writes, and heredoc redirect scanning are hardened against stale or unsafe writes.
- **Autopilot and madmax paths are sturdier** — Autopilot ralplan handoff, madmax worktree runtime roots, and madmax resume plugin cache preflight are corrected.
- **HUD Ultragoal status is accurate** — superseded Ultragoal goals render correctly in the HUD.

## [0.18.17] - 2026-07-01

Patch release for the post-`0.18.16` runtime reliability train: Ultragoal null-goal recovery, MSYS/Windows Team startup handling, Ralplan terminal state, planning-gate write guards, and profile mention fallback behavior are tightened while preserving the existing CLI/package contract.

### Changed

- **Planning and conductor guardrails are stricter** — planning-gate state-write guards and exact-role worker routing reduce stale or unsafe planning writes in long-running workflows.
- **Windows and MSYS workflow handling is sturdier** — psmux question rendering and Team worker startup paths are fixed for Windows/MSYS environments.

### Fixed

- **Ultragoal null-goal loops recover cleanly** — repeated `get_goal` null-result loops now have recovery behavior instead of leaving sessions stuck.
- **Ralplan terminal session state is safer** — Ralplan terminal state handling avoids stale or mismatched continuation state.
- **Stop keyword and profile mention edge cases are quieter** — path false positives and Discord mention fallback behavior are corrected.

## [0.18.16] - 2026-06-27

Patch release for the post-`0.18.15` diagnostics and stale-state hardening train: local session friction reporting is available, stale HUD/Ralph continuation state is guarded, and doctor artifact ownership warnings are safer.

### Changed

- **Local session friction reporting is available** — `omx session friction` can surface local run/session friction signals so resume and debugging workflows have more actionable history.

### Fixed

- **Stale HUD and Ralph continuation state is guarded** — HUD review status and Ralph Stop continuation handling avoid carrying stale review/stop signals across later workflow phases.
- **Doctor artifact ownership diagnostics are safer** — `omx doctor` detects root-owned repository artifacts more clearly without over-warning on normal local files.

### PRs

### Verification

## [0.18.15] - 2026-06-25

Patch release for the post-`0.18.14` goal/runtime reliability train: completed-goal cleanup, state-path handling, guided autoresearch intake, MCP parity coverage, and native-hook resilience were tightened before the `0.18.16` follow-up train.

### Fixed

- **Goal and hook cleanup is sturdier** — completed-goal cleanup and native-hook handling are hardened for follow-up workflow runs.
- **State path and autoresearch coverage is broader** — MCP state-path tests and guided autoresearch intake checks protect the release train.

### Verification

- `v0.18.15` was published from commit `e9e3bcc7` and superseded by the `0.18.16` release train.

## [0.18.14] - 2026-06-20

Patch release for the post-`0.18.13` reliability train: agent/model routing diagnostics are clearer, goal/planning workflows are safer, plugin and native-hook behavior is sturdier, HUD/Team/tmux edge cases are tightened, doctor catches root-owned repo artifacts, and resume search discovers madmax run histories.

### Changed

- **Agent/model routing is more transparent** — per-agent model overrides and launch diagnostics expose selected roles, tiers, and launch arguments without changing the default CLI/package contract.
- **Goal and planning workflow guidance is clearer** — completed Codex goal cleanup, Ralplan transition diagnostics, supervised Autopilot review rework, Beads metadata handling, and goal/skill docs reduce stale or ambiguous handoffs.
- **Doctor and resume discovery cover more local cases** — root-owned repo artifact detection and madmax run-history discovery improve troubleshooting and continuation.

### Fixed

- **Plugin, setup, and native hooks are safer** — plugin AGENTS policy blocks survive setup, dev plugin cache diagnostics are clearer, bundled skill agent tier references are present, native hooks succeed on null output, PreToolUse stdout/schema behavior is preserved, and Windows native hook command launching avoids shell wrapping.
- **HUD, Team, and tmux behavior is sturdier** — stale Autopilot HUD state, cramped guard rendering, standalone pane-scoped HUD state, paste-buffer cleanup, worker AGENTS guidance, and HUD pane ownership on shutdown are hardened.
- **Ralplan and Autopilot gates are fresher** — Ralplan consensus approval/freshness checks, guard/HUD phase authority, stale Autopilot stop state, and Ultragoal architecture invariant handling are tightened.

### Issues

- Held open PRs #2902, #2856, #2840, #2839, and #2838 are excluded from this release candidate unless already in `origin/dev`; prep confirmed they are open and `BEHIND` on base `dev`.

### Verification

- Release readiness evidence is tracked in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.18.14.md`.

## [0.18.13] - 2026-06-17

Patch release for the post-`0.18.12` reliability train: project-scoped resume/search discovery is broader, setup and hook handling are safer, ralplan/autopilot consensus gates are fresher, CI/release infrastructure is sturdier, sidecar Team state roots align with runtime behavior, geobench documentation/schema fixes are captured, and release prep selects `0.18.13` rather than `0.19.0` after explicit no-breaking-change review.

### Changed

- **Project resume/search discovery is more complete** — project-scoped runtime Codex homes are included in `omx resume` and `omx session search`, with `--project` and `--codex-home` escape hatches documented for narrower or explicit lookup.
- **CI and release infrastructure is sturdier** — workflows move to GitHub-hosted runners where appropriate, dev-merge issue-close follow-up comments are best-effort, and the `0.18.12` promotion topology is accounted for before preparing `0.18.13`.
- **Geobench visibility is documented** — the curated geobench profile, visibility spec, romanization schema, and enriched profile schema are captured for repeatable benchmark configuration.

### Fixed

- **Setup, hooks, and transcript preservation are safer** — generated native-agent TOMLs preserve user customization, setup overwrite behavior is covered, hook JSON state compatibility is hardened, and project Codex transcripts survive cleanup.
- **Ralplan and Autopilot gates are fresher** — consensus freshness checks, tracker-backed native reviews, target-aware write detection, and Autopilot ralplan handoff validation are tightened.
- **Team sidecar state roots align with runtime behavior** — sidecar collection uses the Team runtime state root, reducing mismatched state inspection.

### Issues

- No open GitHub issues were present at release-scope review time; open PRs #2840, #2839, #2838, and draft #2828 were scoped as fix/docs/warning/safety follow-ups and did not change the `0.18.13` patch decision.

### Verification

## [0.18.12] - 2026-06-12

Patch release for the post-`0.18.11` release-prep train: first-party MCP sibling detection is narrower, manual npm publishing is documented in CI, runtime/HUD/plugin/autopilot safeguards are tightened, Windows hook and state-input paths are safer, and release prep reconciles the main workflow history for `0.18.12`.

### Changed

- **Release and publication workflow is clearer** — manual npm publication workflow support and npm auth configuration are captured, while `0.18.12` release prep reconciles the main workflow history without tagging, merging main, or publishing locally.
- **Runtime and automation gates are stricter** — Autopilot final gates, best-practice-research read-only boundaries, ralplan consensus guards, and deep-interview patch artifact handling are hardened.
- **Plugin and generated guidance handling is safer** — persistent AGENTS guidance, plugin agent merge repair, developer-instruction prompt policy, setup plugin mode inference, and cleanup preservation are tightened.

### Fixed

- **Windows and CLI state paths are safer** — Windows hook shims preserve `Path`, emit `omx.cmd`, use absolute PowerShell hook paths, handle UTF-8 BOM for non-ASCII installs, and `omx state` gains a Windows-safe input surface.
- **HUD/session visibility is more reliable** — dev version labels, stale HUD cleanup, HUD owner matching, terminal skill-active visibility, cancel hook-visible run-dir state, and detached history pruning tolerate more edge cases.
- **MCP sibling detection is narrower** — post-traffic first-party MCP sibling capping avoids overmatching unrelated same-parent processes.

## [0.18.11] - 2026-06-09

Patch release for the post-`0.18.10` cleanup train: the `omx explore` command surface is hard-deprecated, `omx doctor` gains Spark/model lane routing diagnostics, launch-time tmux HUD splitting is safer in cramped windows, and the catalog registers the wiki skill manifest entry.

### Changed

- **`omx explore` command surface is hard-deprecated** — the explore command surface is fully retired and remaining `omx explore` mentions are removed from global AGENTS guidance.
- **Catalog gains the wiki skill manifest entry** — the wiki skill manifest entry is registered so the skill is discoverable through the standard manifest surface.

### Fixed

- **`omx doctor` surfaces Spark/model lane routing** — doctor adds a Spark/model lane routing diagnostic so misrouted model lanes are visible during diagnosis.
- **Launch-time HUD is safer in cramped tmux windows** — the launch-time HUD split is skipped inside cramped existing tmux windows to avoid unusable pane splits during startup.

### PRs

## [0.18.9] - 2026-06-03

Patch release for the post-`0.18.8` update/runtime reliability train: stable/dev update channels, source-install packaging, Windows npm fallback, project-local runtime state lookup, cmux/tmux question rendering, deep-interview visibility/grounding, Autopilot/Ultragoal/review gate clarity, HUD pane scoping, and CI/release evidence hardening.

### Changed

- **Update channels are clearer** — stable and dev update paths are explicit, dev-source updates produce installable package artifacts, and update behavior is safer across local checkouts.
- **Autopilot, review, and Ultragoal gates are clearer** — ralplan write guards are phase-aware, review subagent model/effort choices are respected, and Ultragoal HUD stays active until goals finish.
- **Release and CI evidence is tighter** — fork PR CI avoids self-hosted skips, self-hosted prerequisite install is hardened, and 0.18.8 release evidence cleanup is captured as internal release hygiene.

### Fixed

- **Question and deep-interview rendering is more robust** — `omx question` works under cmux/tmux shims via env prefix delivery, short panes keep deep-interview questions visible, and deep-interview handoffs are grounded in repo docs.
- **Project-local state lookup is safer** — boxed `OMX_ROOT` project memory lookup and project-local resume history listing preserve the intended project context during isolated launches.
- **HUD/update edge cases are covered** — repeated tmux HUD reconciliation stays scoped to the emitting pane, and Windows update global-root lookup falls back to `npm.cmd`.

## [0.18.8] - 2026-06-01

Patch release for the post-`0.18.7` runtime reliability train: HUD/session ownership under native session drift, Autopilot replay and context-snapshot hardening, plugin hook/cache correctness, Team startup/disablement safety, native subagent guidance, and release/CI evidence improvements.

### Changed

- **HUD ownership is more session-authoritative** — source-pane scoping, resize-hook scoping, native session-id drift preservation, prompt-revive dedupe, and deleted-cwd safeguards reduce duplicate or stale HUD panes.
- **Autopilot context and replay behavior is clearer** — terminal turn replay no longer reactivates completed Autopilot state, context snapshots are seeded/hardened, and task-seed provenance is documented.
- **Team/native-agent guidance is tighter** — Team mode can be disabled, tmux worktree startup compatibility is fixed, native executor lanes stay leaf-only, and default native subagent routing guidance is corrected.
- **Release and CI lanes are more explicit** — self-hosted Linux runner selection and GJC evidence lane optimization reduce avoidable broad CI churn.

### Fixed

- **Plugin hook cache and mirror behavior is safer** — stale hook cache refresh, setup-mode preservation, oversized Stop semantics, JSON fallback, and plugin hook metadata verification are protected.
- **HUD edge cases are covered** — fallback authority respawn storms, escaped tmux separators, legacy focused panes, native session drift, and doctor panes for deleted cwd are handled.
- **State and operator help improved** — state operation help and UltraQA temporary harness guidance are updated.

## [0.18.7] - 2026-05-29

Patch release for the post-`0.18.6` runtime reliability train: duplicate HUD and question-renderer pane prevention, HUD ownership preservation across native tmux session replacement, Stop-hook duplicate suppression safety, Autopilot/ralplan gate hardening, Hermes MCP pane routing, and Team coordination protocol updates.

### Changed

- **HUD ownership is more durable** — native session replacement preserves HUD ownership metadata, attached tmux HUD rendering stays singleton, and HUD watch remains bound to its live tmux cwd.
- **Planning and automation gates are stricter** — ralplan remains a planning-only boundary, Autopilot completion requires gate evidence, and command-style Autopilot invocations route through the intended path.
- **Team coordination is documented and typed** — lightweight team coordination protocol docs, state, and tests landed for the worker runtime surface.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate HUD panes are prevented** — standalone HUD restore and attached tmux rendering reuse existing same-owner panes instead of spawning duplicates.
- **Duplicate question/Stop UI paths are safer** — question renderer panes close after answers, duplicate renderer panes are prevented, and duplicate worker Stop nudges preserve recovery evidence.
- **Hermes MCP and detached tmux behavior are safer** — Hermes MCP tmux bridge pane routing is fixed and detached tmux history growth is constrained.
- **Gitignore handling is protected** — effective gitignore regression coverage was added for release-critical file discovery.

## [0.18.6] - 2026-05-27

Patch release for the post-`0.18.5` Ultragoal/HUD rendering follow-up: adaptive HUD line budgets, tmux pane sizing from the same render policy, clearer current-Ultragoal accenting, ANSI-safe truncation, and watch-mode row-budget protection.

### Changed

- **Ultragoal HUD line budget is adaptive** — ordinary sessions keep the compact default while active Ultragoal state can use up to three bounded lines.
- **HUD pane sizing follows render policy** — tmux reconcile/resize behavior now shares the Ultragoal-aware line-budget helper used by rendering.
- **Current Ultragoal context is clearer** — the active goal uses a distinct magenta accent and compact output omits lower-priority next-goal text.

### Fixed

- **ANSI truncation is safer** — constrained-width truncation preserves ANSI styling.
- **Watch-mode output respects the row budget** — watch rendering avoids adding an extra terminal row.

## [0.18.5] - 2026-05-27

Patch release for the post-`0.18.4` Ultragoal/HUD operator-experience train: clearer Ultragoal status when Codex goal storage is unavailable, more readable and compact HUD summaries, duplicate HUD pane prevention, safer `omx question`/Autopilot user-decision handling, narrower doctor warnings, and mandatory independent final review evidence for Ultragoal completion.

### Changed

- **Ultragoal final review evidence is stricter** — final aggregate completion now requires independent code-reviewer and architect evidence before the Codex goal can be marked complete.
- **Ultragoal HUD summaries are more useful** — HUD output is compact, avoids duplicate combined-state summaries, and can show next active/pending Ultragoal items instead of only the current line.
- **Autopilot preserves operator decisions** — deep-interview question handling keeps explicit user decisions intact while waiting through `omx question`.

### Fixed

- **Ultragoal status handles unavailable Codex goal storage** — goal DB unavailability is reported as recovery evidence instead of confusing completion state.
- **HUD pane ownership converges cleanly** — Team/Ultragoal HUD panes no longer duplicate, and convergence still works when pane environment variables are absent.
- **Doctor shared-skill warnings are narrower** — doctor avoids noisy shared skill-root warnings outside the relevant ownership boundary.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-05-26

Patch release for the post-`0.18.3` runtime-safety train: Ultragoal recovery, deprecated explore guidance, Team/HUD ownership fixes, plugin native-agent setup reliability, project-local trust sync, Autopilot question waiting, and ralplan reviewer-contract hardening.

### Changed

- **Explore is formally deprecated** — runtime guidance no longer recommends `omx explore` for new repository lookup work, while leaving compatibility behavior available for legacy callers.
- **Ralplan reviewer contracts are tighter** — reviewer subagents now receive narrower instructions so consensus handoffs stay grounded and do not overstep execution authority.

### Fixed

- **Ultragoal recovery is safer** — plain-label checklist sections are ignored, and completed aggregate goals no longer trigger unrecoverable Stop recovery loops.
- **Autopilot waits for operator answers** — deep-interview question flow can now block on `omx question` instead of racing ahead.
- **Team and HUD ownership is cleaner** — worker UserPromptSubmit no longer owns leader HUD reconciliation, and duplicate HUD pane spawn convergence is fixed.
- **Plugin/native-agent setup is more reliable** — doctor now surfaces missing reviewer roles, plugin native-agent role setup CI is fixed, and plugin-only obsolete native agents are preserved.
- **Project-local trust sync relaunches safely** — Codex config trust sync no longer corrupts config during relaunch.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-05-25

Patch release for the post-`0.18.2` reliability and operator-experience train: HUD/tmux lifecycle cleanup, Team diff gutter preservation, auth slot hot-swap support, visible explore prompt syntax guidance, deep-interview runtime config overrides, stricter `plan_then_execute` handoff authority, plugin-owned hook preservation, and the Scholastic ontology reviewer agent.

### Added

- **Scholastic ontology reviewer** — adds a first-class Scholastic reviewer agent across definitions, native config, catalog, plugin metadata, and docs.
- **Skills/agents bloat audit collateral** — records the inventory and connectivity roadmap for future consolidation work.

### Changed

- **Deep-interview runtime configuration** — supports `deepInterview` runtime config overrides and mirrors the guidance through canonical and plugin skill surfaces.
- **Auth slot hot-swap support** — includes the auth slot hot-swap wrapper from the final `dev` delta.
- **Explore prompt syntax visibility** — keeps prompt syntax visible in runtime guidance.
- **Handoff authority is stricter** — `plan_then_execute` downstream authority is enforced as a binding gate for deep-interview/ralplan handoffs.

### Fixed

- **HUD lifecycle and ownership** — coalesces launch HUD panes by leader, preserves session id and owner env during reconcile, reaps dead-leader HUD panes, and reuses the existing HUD during UserPromptSubmit revive.
- **Team diff readability** — preserves diff gutters on wrapped multi-line hunks.
- **Plugin hook ownership** — respects plugin-owned hooks without overwriting user/plugin surfaces during setup/update paths.

Patch release for the closed post-`0.18.1` issue train. This release promotes the `dev` fixes for every currently closed, completed GitHub issue opened after `v0.18.1`, plus the Prometheus Strict planner surface and Ultragoal HUD progress display that also merged during the compare range.

### Added

- **Prometheus Strict recipe workflow** — restores a recipe-only interview-driven planner surface with `omx question` routing, native agent definitions, catalog entries, mirrored plugin skill files, and dogfood documentation (#2415, #2437).
- **Ultragoal HUD progress** — HUD output now summarizes active Ultragoal progress and tightens review follow-up handling so long-running durable goals stay visible during execution (#2472).

### Changed

- **Autopilot and planning handoffs are more auditable** — Autopilot now exposes the full durable phase chain, ralplan consensus requires explicit Architect/Critic evidence before handoff, and ralplan examples point to Ultragoal as the default durable execution path (#2432, #2447, #2455).
- **Deep-interview remains a requirements boundary** — deep-interview handoffs now avoid implicit implementation and preserve explicit execution transition requirements (#2427).
- **Research workflow guidance is clearer** — best-practice research, Autoresearch, Autoresearch Goal, and ralplan now have sharper boundaries, with in-repo docs CSS paths verified (#2469).

### Fixed

- **Plugin/native hook reliability** — doctor no longer warns about missing setup-owned `hooks.json` when plugin-mode hook coverage is valid, native review subagents no longer activate workflow state from quoted parent keywords, and project-scope runtime `CODEX_HOME` launches no longer duplicate native hooks or lose trust state (#2431, #2448, #2471).
- **Tmux/HUD/madmax stability** — tmux 3.2a-compatible resize hooks, per-run madmax detached lock identity, stale-lock diagnostics/recovery, boxed `OMX_ROOT` forwarding, per-leader HUD ownership, and clearer same-directory madmax lock diagnostics are included (#2434, #2436, #2442, #2452, #2461, #2463).
- **Team and notification safety** — team startup-direct evidence gates, team Stop state isolation, and bounded Codex Desktop `turn-ended` notification dispatch prevent false success paths and runaway notify storms (#2439, #2450, #2457).
- **Ultragoal recovery** — unavailable Codex goal storage such as `no such table: thread_goals` is classified and checkpointed as non-terminal blocked recovery evidence instead of trapping completed work (#2467).

### Closed issue audit

Opened after `v0.18.1` and currently closed:

- Completed and merged to `dev`: #2429→#2431, #2430→#2432, #2433→#2434, #2435→#2436, #2438→#2439, #2440→#2442, #2443→#2447, #2445→#2448, #2449→#2450, #2451→#2452, #2453→#2455, #2456→#2457, #2460→#2461, #2462→#2463, #2466→#2467, #2468→#2469, #2470→#2471.
- Closed as not planned / not an execution-track merge: #2428 (too broad; requested narrower follow-ups) and #2465 (contribution-gate closure). These had no required release merge.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-05-19

Minor release focused on local-generation infrastructure, SparkShell operator safety, and runtime reliability after `0.17.3`. The release adds the OMX API gateway, routes SparkShell summaries through the local API surface, improves real/local generation compatibility, and closes a cluster of hook, notify, tmux, Windows MCP, and workflow-state regressions found while preparing the release.

### Added

- **OMX API gateway for local generation** — new `omx api` support provides a localhost-compatible API surface for OMX-owned generation flows and SparkShell summaries.
- **Bounded best-practice research workflow** — `$best-practice-research` gives release and implementation work an upstream-evidence-first workflow with explicit bounds.
- **SparkShell diagnostics for operators** — SparkShell can summarize team panes, cache pane observations incrementally, preserve passthrough contracts, and keep raw secrets out of summaries.

### Changed

- **Real/local generation compatibility** — local real generation paths and Responses metadata propagation are aligned with the OMX API gateway.
- **Release and CI readiness** — targeted CI lanes reduce wasted PR work, API CLI tests are more reliable under load, and the release train now includes `omx api` / `omx sparkshell` smoke coverage.
- **Workflow durability across compaction** — autopilot review state and autoresearch-goal Stop reconciliation survive the handoff conditions that previously caused review skips or stale loops.

### Fixed

- **Notify recursion and fork bombs** — stale wrapper recursion, `previousNotify` self-reference, fallback watcher respawns, and dispatcher recursive forks are blocked.
- **Stop/hook false positives** — stale Ralph/ralplan state, autoresearch-goal reconciliation drift, MCP transport false positives, and tmux diagnostic false positives no longer trigger erroneous lifecycle loops.
- **Team/tmux/HUD/Windows reliability** — wrapped tmux drafts are no longer trusted as sent input, HUD resize hooks survive reflow, worker tmux rc fan-out is stopped, provider env vars are preserved for directly launched tmux sessions, and Windows MCP siblings avoid duplicate watchdog collisions.
- **Advisor prompt compatibility** — `omx ask` role prompts that start with YAML frontmatter are handled correctly.
- **0.18.0 release blockers** — API auth defaults, request bounds, redaction, help text, version metadata, and smoke commands were hardened before release.

### PRs

- #2295, #2332, #2334, #2335, #2338, #2339, #2341, #2342, #2344, #2345, #2347, #2349, #2351, #2357, #2359, #2360, #2361, #2365, #2367, #2372, #2374, #2375, #2376

### Verification

- Release readiness evidence is tracked in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.18.0.md`.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-05-14

### Highlights

- **Team launch works again with CLI-first/plugin Codex configs** — Codex team workers no longer synthesize first-party `mcp_servers.<omx>` config tables when those servers are absent from `CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, avoiding Codex's `invalid transport` startup failure while preserving the v0.17.1 worker-isolation behavior for legacy configured servers.
- **AGENTS contract and plugin metadata hardening ride with the hotfix train** — the compare range also includes AGENTS overwrite protection and plugin/question test metadata alignment from `dev` after `0.17.2`.

### Fixes / compatibility

- `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_MCP_COMPAT=1` remains a supported escape hatch and still suppresses worker MCP disable overrides.
- Legacy configs that explicitly declare `omx_state`, `omx_memory`, `omx_code_intel`, `omx_trace`, `omx_wiki`, or `omx_hermes` still get those servers disabled for Codex team workers by default.
- CLI-first/plugin configs without those first-party MCP tables now launch team workers normally instead of failing before readiness.

### Validation

- `npm run build`
- `node --test dist/team/__tests__/tmux-session.test.js`
- `npm run check:no-unused`
- Live default team launch smoke: `./dist/cli/omx.js team 1:explore "default smoke launch fixed"`
- Live compatibility smoke: `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_MCP_COMPAT=1 ./dist/cli/omx.js team 1:explore "compat smoke launch still fixed"`

## [0.17.2] - 2026-05-14

Hotfix release for the `omx question` leader-pane resume regression observed after structured question / Hermes coordination integration.

### Fixed

- **Structured question answers resume the leader pane again** — answered question records with persisted renderer `return_target` metadata now send the bounded `[omx question answered]` notice back through the existing safe tmux-send-keys path for both local UI answers and Hermes/MCP structured submissions.
- **Hermes question bridge contract clarified** — coordinators still submit bounded structured answers to question records, but OMX-owned records may use their persisted return-pane metadata for the leader resume notice; this is not an arbitrary terminal relay.

### Validation

- `npm run build`
- `env -u OMX_STATE_ROOT -u OMX_ROOT -u OMX_SESSION_ID -u CODEX_SESSION_ID -u SESSION_ID node --test dist/question/__tests__/state.test.js dist/question/__tests__/ui.test.js dist/mcp/__tests__/hermes-bridge.test.js dist/question/__tests__/renderer.test.js`
- `npm run check:no-unused`
- `npx biome lint src/question src/mcp/hermes-bridge.ts`

### Release metadata

- Node and Cargo package metadata are bumped to `0.17.2` for the hotfix cut.
- Release readiness evidence is tracked in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.17.2.md`.
- PR inventory: #2330.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-05-14

Patch release focused on post-`0.17.0` release readiness and runtime-coordination hardening: Team + Ultragoal handoff guidance, question bridge events, setup MCP removal confirmation, HUD/tmux resize ownership, Team startup readiness, native session overlay preservation, and audit-clean release metadata.

### Added

- **Team + Ultragoal bridge guidance** — planning, ralplan, Team, and Ultragoal now document leader-owned goal/ledger state with Team-owned parallel execution evidence.
- **Question bridge events** — question coordination now records structured bridge events for bounded Hermes/MCP integrations.

### Changed

- **Approved execution handoff contract** — approved repository context replaces the older context-pack handoff path; approved PRD/test-spec artifacts and Team evidence are now the release-train source of truth.
- **Setup MCP removal** — setup-managed MCP removal is explicitly confirmed instead of silently applying default removals.
- **Lore commit guard** — compact compliant commit messages are accepted while preserving the required OmX co-author trailer.

### Fixed

- **Release audit and version metadata** — Node/Cargo metadata now align to `0.17.1`, and vulnerable transitive npm packages in the lockfile were updated so `npm audit --audit-level=high` is clean.
- **Team startup reliability** — workers avoid redundant MCP startup, idle Ultragoal plans do not trigger accidental Team startup, and draft-only Team startup fails after ready timeout.
- **HUD/tmux stability** — resize hooks enforce HUD pane height and avoid ownership collisions across windows.
- **Native session overlays** — user-generated AGENTS guidance is preserved across native session replacement while generated project boilerplate is omitted.
- **Ralph completion guidance** — examples now require auditable completion evidence before done-state claims.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-12

Minor release focused on new coordination and workflow surfaces: bounded Hermes MCP coordination, canonical `$design` workflow guidance, plugin-mode skill marketplace exposure, adversarial UltraQA contracts, Windows native-hook reliability, tmux ownership safety, startup shell isolation, committed project-memory loading, and Ultragoal task-scoped goal reconciliation.

### Added

- **Hermes MCP bridge** — bounded tools for session/status reads, audited follow-up dispatch, safe artifact reads, log tails, session starts, and coordination reports without exposing tmux scrollback or raw private state.
- **Canonical design workflow** — `DESIGN.md` and mirrored `$design` skill guidance now define the design workflow; `frontend-ui-ux` is deprecated.
- **Plugin-mode skill discovery** — setup registers and verifies the local Codex plugin marketplace/cache and plugin-scoped MCP metadata, including Hermes.

### Changed

- **UltraQA is adversarial by contract** — guidance now requires hostile scenario modeling, prompt injection attempts, interrupts/cancel/resume, stale state checks, temporary harnesses when useful, and cleanup evidence.
- **CLI-first runtime authority is clearer** — docs and guidance distinguish CLI-owned runtime behavior from MCP/default setup paths.

### Fixed

- **Windows native hook launch** — PowerShell `ProcessStartInfo` shim preserves stdin/stdout/stderr and exit status across spaces and quoting-sensitive paths.
- **Tmux continuation ownership** — follow-up injection verifies mode/session/window ownership before sending prompts to panes.
- **Startup shell isolation** — tmux launches avoid shell rc fan-out before Codex starts.
- **Ultragoal completion reconciliation** — completed task-scoped aggregate Codex goals can be reconciled to the active OMX story with strict evidence and final quality gates.
- **Release-review test isolation** — MCP/Hermes state-path tests isolate inherited OMX runtime environment and canonicalize macOS temp roots so symlink-root security checks remain reproducible.

## [0.16.4] - 2026-05-11

Patch release focused on post-`0.16.3` workflow reliability: approved execution handoff integrity, context-pack metadata visibility, Codex hook feature-flag migration, setup/notify ownership safety, HUD/runtime state-root visibility, Ralph completion audit evidence, and Ultragoal completion proof requirements.

### Added

- **Approved context references** — Ralph, Team, and planning handoffs can carry approved context-pack references, private entry metadata, canonical PRD aliases, and ready role refs through the execution lifecycle.
- **Ralph completion audit guardrails** — Ralph completion now records and checks audit evidence before accepting done-state claims.

### Changed

- **Ultragoal completion proof is stricter** — final cleanup/review proof is required before Ultragoal completion, and docs/skills now make that stop condition explicit.
- **Skill catalog hygiene** — obsolete catalog entries were pruned and skill guidance was tightened around active OMX runtime surfaces.

### Fixed

- **Codex hook feature flag compatibility** — setup probes `codex features list` and writes the current `[features].hooks = true` flag when supported, while retaining legacy `[features].codex_hooks = true` fallback for older Codex releases and deduping stale aliases during refresh.
- **Setup, notify, and hook-state ownership** — setup mode switches avoid duplicate hook state, hooks stay active after clear resets, stale PostCompact wiring is detected, and OMX notify dispatch no longer recursively wraps itself.
- **Approved execution and planning durability** — approved handoffs survive Team scale-up, multiline launch hints, visible hint lineage fallbacks, and context-pack diagnostics/markdown parsing edge cases.
- **Runtime visibility and cleanup** — HUD visualization stays rooted in OMX runtime authority, plugin-mode skill discovery and plugin MCP cleanup are safer, and boxed Team state-root precedence is corrected.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-05-09

Patch release focused on post-`0.16.2` native-hook/setup/runtime hardening: supported Codex hook feature flags, safer notify ownership, runtime hook-trust mirroring, Team startup-evidence state isolation, approved handoff context, planning context-pack references, stale Ralph resume prevention, and native compact-hook JSON validity.

### Added

- **Approved handoff context for Team workers** — workers receive explicit approved handoff context, ready context-pack role references, and preserved launch signatures/hints.

### Changed

- **Codex hook setup uses the supported feature flag** — generated setup/runtime config now emits `[features].hooks = true` and migrates unsupported feature-table aliases back to the supported key.
- **Runtime state and planning reads are more local by default** — Team startup evidence, planning artifacts, and delivery logs avoid global OMX state contamination unless an explicit Team state root is configured.

### Fixed

- **User hook/notify ownership** — setup and uninstall preserve user-owned notify/hook state, avoid basename-only managed notify matches, and remap project runtime hook trust to the runtime mirror.
- **Native hook lifecycle correctness** — PreCompact/PostCompact output remains valid JSON, Windows/global install startup self-updates are deferred, and Codex startup exits are surfaced.
- **Workflow lifecycle reliability** — stale Ralph sessions no longer auto-resume, blocked autoresearch Stop reconciliation is explicit, and Team startup-evidence regressions are covered.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-05-08

Post-`0.16.1` release-train correction and workflow hardening: aggregate `$ultragoal` Codex goals, commit-shared wiki/compaction support, session-isolated stateful workflows, setup-owned Codex hook trust state, and a release-review correction for generated hook feature flags.

### Added

- **Aggregate `$ultragoal` mode** — new ultragoal plans default to one aggregate Codex objective while OMX records per-story checkpoints; legacy per-story mode remains available for existing/no-mode plans and explicit `--codex-goal-mode per-story`.
- **Commit-shared project wiki** — canonical wiki storage now lives under repository-root `omx_wiki/`, with native `PreCompact`/`PostCompact` hooks to preserve durable compaction findings.
- **Setup-owned Codex hook trust state** — setup writes trust records for generated `codex-native-hook.js` wrappers while preserving user hook state.

### Changed

- **Goal-mode handoff guidance** — ultragoal docs, skill/plugin mirrors, planning, ralplan, deep-interview, and planner guidance now recommend `$ultragoal` as the default durable goal-mode follow-up.
- **Wiki compatibility boundary** — legacy `.omx/wiki/` remains a read-only fallback when canonical `omx_wiki/` is absent.

### Fixed

- **Stateful workflow session isolation** — session-scoped workflow state no longer inherits or autocompletes from root/global workflow entries; explicit `all_sessions` clears remain the global cleanup path.
- **Codex hook feature-flag regression** — release review restored generated config to `[features].hooks = true`, repairs legacy `[features].codex_hooks = true` aliases, and updates setup/docs/tests/plugin mirrors accordingly.
- **Release body generation** — `RELEASE_BODY.md` again includes the required contributors anchor for generated GitHub release notes.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-05-08

Patch release focused on post-`0.16.0` reliability and release-safety hardening: bounded explore execution, safer local explore fast-path reads, clean CI dependency-install proof, session-scoped runtime authority, approved Team handoff repair behavior, context-pack status visibility, deep-interview flow clarity, and launch/runtime fixes.

### Added
- **Context-pack handoff status visibility** — approved execution paths can expose read-only context-pack readiness/status so follow-up repair behavior is explicit.
- **Explore fast-path regression coverage** — local explore tests now cover symlink fallback and oversized text-search fallback behavior.

### Changed
- **CI dependency proof is clean again** — Node CI jobs run `npm ci` unconditionally instead of skipping install on a restored `node_modules` cache.
- **Team approved handoffs are stricter and more repairable** — selected handoffs, invalid diagnostics, nonready repair-only handling, binding transport, and DAG fallback status stay aligned.
- **Runtime/session authority is more durable** — session-scoped runtime state, project-scoped Codex goal state, and stale skill-active/HUD cleanup are tightened.

### Fixed
- **Explore local fast-path boundary hardening** — explicit local file reads reject symlinks before reading, and text search uses bounded reads instead of loading oversized files.
- **Explore process storm protection** — Codex-backed explore execution has stronger process/output limits before semantic fallback.
- **Launch/runtime reliability** — Darwin worktree launch assertions, Windows OMX root paths, current JS runtime helpers, plugin skill cache refresh, MCP sibling cleanup, visual Ralph recovery, and native hook background output were hardened.

### Verification
- Release readiness evidence is tracked in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.16.1.md`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-06

Minor release focused on skill deprecation and native Codex goal-mode integration. This release prepares durable goal workflows, Codex goal snapshot reconciliation, Team/Ralph goal handoff safety, and catalog/plugin skill delivery cleanup after `0.15.3`.

### Added
- **Native goal-mode workflows** — `ultragoal`, `performance-goal`, and `autoresearch-goal` provide durable repo artifacts, model-facing Codex goal handoffs, validation ledgers, and completion reconciliation.
- **Goal workflow validation substrate** — shared helpers record workflow state, ledgers, validation summaries, and fresh Codex goal snapshot checks before accepting completion.
- **Pipeline package templates and docs** — GitHub package pipeline templates, goal workflow docs, Discord integration docs, and release-readiness evidence are expanded.

### Changed
- **Ralph and Team goal handoffs are stricter** — completion paths now respect Codex goal-mode truth boundaries and approved execution context.
- **Explore, notification, and CI paths are hardened** — explore startup bounds, notification proxy handling, question handshakes, boxed state routing, and split CI/package checks improve release reliability.

### Deprecated
- **Direct `omx autoresearch` launch remains deprecated** — use `$autoresearch` or `omx autoresearch-goal` for goal-mode-backed research workflows.

### Removed
- **Catalog-deprecated plugin skill delivery** — obsolete skills retired from installable/plugin delivery where catalog-deprecated; deprecated root wrappers may remain as compatibility stubs.

### Fixed
- **False-completion risk in goal workflows** — completion checkpoints require matching objective/status evidence from fresh Codex goal snapshots.
- **Runtime lifecycle leaks** — stale Stop handling, MCP sibling cleanup, Ralph session rebinding, boxed state routing, and worker Stop behavior are tightened.

### Verification
- Release readiness evidence is tracked in `docs/qa/release-readiness-0.16.0.md`; publication remains blocked until local gates and GitHub CI pass.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-29

Patch release focused on release-train hardening after `0.15.0`: direct/non-tmux leader launch controls, passive read-only state operations, concrete repo-aware Team DAG dependency remapping, setup/plugin-mode recovery, audited exec follow-ups, and runtime/hook reliability fixes.

### Added
- **Direct leader launch controls** — `omx --direct` and `OMX_LAUNCH_POLICY=direct|tmux|detached-tmux|auto` let operators opt out of OMX tmux/HUD management without changing the default detached-tmux startup behavior.
- **Audited exec follow-ups** — running non-interactive `omx exec` jobs can receive queued follow-up instructions through the audited inject path.

### Changed
- **State reads are passive** — `state_read`, `state_list_active`, and `state_get_status` no longer initialize `.omx/state` or tmux-hook config as a side effect.
- **Repo-aware Team DAG handoffs use concrete task IDs** — symbolic dependencies are remapped after task creation, then patched onto runtime task records before worker inbox/bootstrap generation.
- **Setup/plugin guidance is clearer** — setup preserves explicit legacy/plugin choices, archives stale legacy assets in plugin mode, and documents direct launch escape hatches.

### Fixed
- **Runtime and hook hardening** — Stop lifecycle reads prefer canonical run-state, MCP state persistence survives transport disconnects, prompt resume avoids unverified PID hard failures, source-log text no longer trips hook blocks, and macOS startup polling pressure is reduced.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, plugin manifest, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.15.1`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-25

Minor release focused on making OMX easier to install, ship, and operate across Codex CLI, Codex App, plugin, native-agent, tmux, and Rust-backed execution surfaces. This release prepares the plugin delivery train, Visual Ralph, setup install-mode selection, native agent/model routing, hook/runtime hardening, Windows/tmux question reliability, CI hang protection, Rust compatibility fixes, and release collateral for the `0.15.0` cut.

### Added
- **First-party Codex plugin packaging** — OMX now ships a mirrored `plugins/oh-my-codex` bundle, plugin marketplace metadata, Codex App compatibility descriptors, plugin bundle SSOT checks, and install-mode setup coverage.
- **Visual Ralph workflow** — `visual-ralph` is now a first-class workflow skill with routing, metadata validation, generated docs, and regression coverage.
- **Native-agent policy/model routing** — native subagent definitions, model table generation, and setup overwrite tests now preserve the `gpt-5.5` frontier, `gpt-5.4-mini` standard, and `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` fast-lane contract.
- **Document refresh enforcement and first-party MCP surfaces** — setup/config paths now include the new refresh-enforcer and first-party MCP configuration coverage.

### Changed
- **Setup can choose plugin or legacy skill delivery** — project setup now preserves persisted install mode, reports plugin cleanup/backups, keeps managed hooks/runtime assets aligned, and makes next steps clearer for Codex App and CLI users.
- **Plugin and generated assets are checked from one source of truth** — native-agent verification, plugin mirror sync, generated catalog docs, and package bin/layout tests now guard release packaging drift.
- **Team/runtime prompts are more explicit about safe execution** — worker, team, Ralph, doctor, help, and setup guidance now better describe plugin mode, runtime ownership, and action-first execution boundaries.
- **Release base handling is explicit** — `v0.14.4` exists but is not an ancestor of the current `dev` candidate; this release uses `v0.14.3` as the verified reachable compare base and records that range caveat in release collateral.

### Fixed
- **Codex App and plugin hook compatibility** — App sessions avoid tmux-only runtime paths, plugin-prefixed skills route correctly, scoped plugin content stays aligned with canonical sources, and setup avoids overwriting local ignore state.
- **Windows/tmux question reliability** — Windows/non-attached question rendering and console behavior have stronger fallbacks and regression coverage.
- **Hook and watcher hardening** — notification fallback watchers, derived watchers, stale tmux sockets, Stop-hook parseability, and setup plugin fixes are covered by targeted regressions.
- **CI and Rust compatibility** — Node test execution has bounded silence handling, and the explore harness remains compatible with Cargo/Rust 1.73-era constraints.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.15.0`.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-04-24

Patch release focused on promoting the default frontier lane from `gpt-5.4` to `gpt-5.5` while preserving the exact `gpt-5.4-mini` standard/mini seam and the `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` spark lane. Docs, setup/config guidance, templates, regression coverage, and release metadata are aligned to that contract.

### Changed
- **Frontier defaults now target `gpt-5.5`** — runtime defaults, Codex agent defaults, and `omx explore` fallback behavior now use `gpt-5.5` instead of `gpt-5.4`.
- **Setup/config guidance matches the new frontier default** — config seeding docs and regression coverage now describe `gpt-5.5` while preserving the same `250000 / 200000` context recommendations.
- **Setup and executor reasoning default to medium** — generated setup config and executor worker launch defaults now use medium reasoning instead of high.
- **Mini and spark lanes remain exact** — `gpt-5.4-mini` and `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` behavior remains unchanged, with prompt guidance and tests still enforcing exact-match semantics.

### Fixed
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.14.4`.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-04-22

Patch release focused on the latest `dev` hardening train after `0.14.2`: question/deep-interview return-pane reliability, project-local explore launch context, setup TOML repair safety, HUD reconcile window targeting, ultrawork protocol alignment, BusyBox cleanup compatibility, stale Stop/autopilot state handling, canonical runtime supervisor events, Docker-host tmux question rendering, and native Windows psmux worker pane bootstrap hardening.

### Added
- **Canonical supervisor runtime events** — runtime command-event contracts now include canonical event types for supervisor control and downstream dispatch/readiness decisions.
- **Deep-interview summary gates** — oversized interview flows now require compact summaries before continuing.
- **Docker-host tmux question bridge** — question rendering can bridge docker-host tmux detection for visible operator prompts.

### Changed
- **Question replies preserve the leader pane** — tool-launched `omx question` flows retain and reuse the correct return pane across prompt reseeding and renderer metadata races.
- **Explore respects project-local Codex homes** — launch/session helpers honor persisted project setup scope by resolving `CODEX_HOME` to the project `.codex` directory when appropriate.
- **Setup config repair is safer** — multiline root TOML strings are parsed as root entries so setup refreshes no longer orphan fragments or corrupt `developer_instructions`-style values.
- **HUD reconciliation stays window-local** — hook-driven HUD resize/reconcile work targets the emitting tmux window.
- **Ultrawork protocol stays aligned upstream** — the shipped ultrawork skill incorporates the upstream protocol refresh used by oh-my-openagent.
- **Native Windows worker panes are more robust** — psmux worker bootstrap avoids stale pane/startup assumptions.

### Fixed
- **Answered deep-interview rounds no longer re-prompt** — stale question state is reconciled against answered records before enforcement asks again.
- **Question answers no longer stall on renderer metadata races** — renderer return-target metadata is stabilized so answers can be injected back to the invoking pane.
- **Detached/hidden question prompts remain operator-visible** — question rendering fails closed or bridges to visible tmux contexts instead of leaving prompts hidden from the operator.
- **BusyBox cleanup compatibility** — cleanup retries process discovery with the BusyBox-compatible `args` field when `ps` rejects `command`.
- **Native Stop no longer loops on stale autopilot planning state** — stale planning state is cleared/reconciled before Stop handling repeats.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.14.3`.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-04-21

Patch release focused on fast-follow operator reliability after `0.14.1`: safer `omx question` renderer behavior outside attached tmux panes, leak-resistant MCP duplicate cleanup, tighter deep-interview session-state handling, Korean IME drift handling for the `ulw` ultrawork shorthand, shared tmux answer-submit semantics for `omx question`, clearer deep-interview background-question guidance, TypeScript/Biome baseline refresh, and release collateral alignment.

### Added
- **Korean `ulw` keyboard drift handling** — prompts typed as `ㅕㅣㅈ` on a Korean 2-set keyboard normalize to the existing `ulw` ultrawork shorthand before workflow activation.
- **Background `omx question` guidance** — deep-interview skill/template/native-hook guidance now instructs agents to wait for background question terminals to finish and read the JSON answer before continuing.

### Changed
- **Question answer injection now reuses shared tmux submit semantics** — `src/question/renderer.ts` delegates to `buildSendPaneArgvs`, keeping literal text delivery, newline sanitization, and isolated `C-m` submits aligned with the reply-listener pane-send path.
- **Question renderer now fails closed outside attached tmux** — `omx question` now refuses to create a detached tmux session when no visible attached pane exists, surfacing a clear operator-facing error instead of launching an unseen renderer.
- **Deep-interview keyword intent is narrower** — cleanup/state-management mentions of “deep interview” no longer trigger the workflow unless activation intent is explicit.
- **TypeScript baseline refreshed** — TypeScript is updated to `6.0.3`, Biome lockfile metadata is refreshed to `2.4.12`, and `tsconfig.json` pins Node ambient types for the TS 6 build path.

### Fixed
- **Stale duplicate MCP siblings** — older duplicate stdio servers now self-exit after a safe post-traffic idle window instead of lingering indefinitely after seeing traffic.
- **Session-scoped clear fallback leaks** — clearing a tracked mode in an active session now writes an inactive session tombstone when needed so legacy root fallback state does not immediately report the mode active again.
- **Failed question launches clear deep-interview obligations** — deep-interview no longer leaves a pending question obligation behind when the renderer cannot launch.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.14.2`.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-21

Patch release focused on hardening the new interactive orchestration surfaces shipped in `0.14.0`: question-pane reliability across tmux environments, deep-interview Stop enforcement and reused-session bridging, setup/update refresh resilience, lifecycle contract deduplication, and code-review / lightweight fallback guidance polish.

### Added
- **Deep-interview bridge guidance for reused sessions** — prompt-side context now includes a concrete current-session CLI bridge command when bare `omx question` is unavailable.
- **Detached question renderer liveness coverage** — regression tests now assert that detached tmux question sessions survive launch and fail closed when they disappear immediately.

### Changed
- **Code-review workflow guidance is stronger** — the shipped code-review skill now requires a more comprehensive, dual-perspective review posture.
- **Lightweight native fallback lanes are leaner** — `omx explore` / `omx sparkshell` fallback guidance stays on mini/spark lanes without polluting the general role roster.
- **Lifecycle normalization now delegates to the shared contract** — terminal lifecycle compatibility helpers reuse the centralized run-outcome contract instead of carrying a divergent copy.

### Fixed
- **Pending deep-interview questions now keep Stop blocked even after the mode marks itself inactive**.
- **Question panes stay alive under non-POSIX tmux shells and fail closed when panes/sessions disappear during launch**.
- **Accepted setup refreshes no longer destroy managed `AGENTS.md`, and postinstall/setup refresh stays rooted to npm's install prefix**.
- **Explicit `omx update` now reruns setup refresh when the installed code is current but the setup stamp is stale, and update-check state write failures no longer block explicit updates**.
- **Stale Ralph / skill-active / ultrawork Stop state no longer leaks across sessions or floods Stop handling**.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.14.1`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-19

Minor release centered on interactive orchestration changes: the new `omx question` blocking-question entrypoint, deep-interview and autoresearch flow tightening, advisory triage routing, explicit runtime run outcomes, specialist-routing cleanup, and release-proof hardening for the shipped package.

### Added
- **`omx question` CLI entrypoint** — OMX now exposes an owned blocking-question command that accepts structured prompt payloads, records question state, renders tmux/native UI flows, and returns structured answers to the invoking agent/runtime.
- **Structured deep-interview question obligations** — deep-interview rounds now create explicit pending-question obligations so OMX can track completion and prevent premature Stop while a required question is still unanswered.
- **Advisory triage routing layer** — non-keyword prompts can now receive PASS/LIGHT/HEAVY routing hints backed by persisted triage state and follow-up suppression.

### Changed
- **Deep-interview uses `omx question` end-to-end** — interactive clarification now routes through the structured question UI instead of fallback ad-hoc prompting, making question ownership and lifecycle explicit.
- **Autoresearch is now skill-first and validator-gated** — direct `omx autoresearch` invocation is hard-deprecated in favor of the prompt/skill workflow, and completion now requires validator evidence.
- **Runtime continuation semantics are explicit** — run outcomes are normalized into a shared terminal/non-terminal contract so stop/continue behavior stays consistent across runtime loops and state surfaces.
- **Specialist routing guidance is clearer** — repository lookup, official-doc research, and dependency-evaluation routes now have narrower ownership boundaries in prompts and role routing.
- **Lint validation now targets tracked source roots** — `npm run lint` validates `src` and `bin` directly so nested local worktrees/runtime dirs with their own Biome roots no longer break release gating.

### Fixed
- **Stop gating around interactive work** — pending deep-interview questions and incomplete autoresearch validation now block Stop consistently until their required interactive/validator work is satisfied.
- **Question/runtime UI integration** — renderer strategy selection, answer injection, and question-state transitions are covered by the new question runtime path instead of split ad-hoc handling.
- **Release metadata drift** — Node/Cargo metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness collateral are aligned to `0.14.0`.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-04-18

Patch release covering security hardening, persistent-hook and Stop-handling correctness, Ralph activation and recovery safety, explore reentry guards, worker runtime identity preservation, skill UX refinements, and release-workflow metadata polish.

### Added
- **Analyze skill revival** — the `analyze` skill returns as a read-only, truth-telling investigation surface for OMX sessions. (PR [#1687](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1687))
- **OMX skill display prefix** — OMX-installed skills are now marked in `/skills` without being renamed, so users can tell OMX-managed skills apart from local ones. (PR [#1686](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1686))
- **Shift+Enter tmux triage docs** — documented Shift+Enter newline behavior in tmux so operators can separate terminal/env issues from OMX regressions. (PR [#1683](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1683), issue [#1682](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1682))

### Fixed

#### Security / hardening
- **Path traversal in identifier handling** — validated identifiers before they reach team/session joins and closed the parent path-traversal surface. (PRs [#1658](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1658), [#1674](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1674), issue [#1650](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1650))
- **HUD state shell and regex injection** — `execFileSync` was replaced with async `execFile` in leader git polling, and git helpers now reject shell/regex metacharacters with regression coverage for HUD `remoteName` inputs. (PRs [#1662](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1662), [#1652](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1652))
- **Reply acknowledgement redaction** — notification reply acknowledgements no longer leak quoted or multi-part secrets, without reviving unrelated watcher churn. (PR [#1670](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1670))
- **Transitive dependency vulnerabilities** — `npm audit fix` applied to patch transitive dependency CVEs. (PR [#1669](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1669))

#### Stop / persistent hooks
- **Native Stop auto-nudge** — native Stop auto-nudge now runs without being gated by the OMX runtime, while active OMX workflows still block Stop until they truly finish; Stop-hook cleanup stays green under the no-unused CI check. (PR [#1707](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1707))

#### Ralph / runtime authority
- **Conversational Ralph mention gating** — casual mentions of Ralph in conversation no longer seed workflow state, preventing accidental activation. (PR [#1697](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1697), issue [#1696](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1696))
- **Ralph continuation recovery** — Ralph stays visibly active across continuation recovery, with dead Ralph cooldown state removed so CI stays green. (PR [#1681](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1681), issue [#1677](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1677))
- **Ralph steer-lock retry cap** — `withRalphSteerLock` retries are now capped to prevent unbounded stale-lock loops. (PR [#1663](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1663))
- **Worker runtime identity preservation** — worker runtime role identity survives startup and scaling, with worker identity verification collapsed into one narrow, reviewable path. (PR [#1676](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1676))

#### Explore / launch safety
- **Explore shell-startup re-entry fail-closed** — `omx explore` fails closed on shell-startup re-entry instead of recursing. (PR [#1700](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1700), issue [#1698](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1698))
- **Explore allowlist wrapper self-resolution** — `omx explore` allowlist wrappers no longer self-resolve and recurse. (PR [#1695](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1695), issue [#1692](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1692))

#### Hooks / notifications / session state
- **Forked notify-hook routing** — forked notify-hook activity stays attached to the active fork session instead of drifting. (PR [#1680](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1680), issue [#1679](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1679))
- **Stale watcher PID reuse** — notify-fallback-watcher verifies process identity before reaping stale PIDs, with a plain-text PID fallback, lock-directory holder PID, liveness checks, and a Windows guard. (PR [#1672](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1672), issue [#1657](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1657))
- **tmux extended-keys stale lock recovery** — tmux extended-keys lease lock now recovers from stale holders instead of hanging indefinitely. (PR [#1668](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1668), issue [#1655](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1655))
- **MCP duplicate sibling cleanup** — post-traffic duplicate MCP siblings self-exit after extended idle instead of leaking. (PR [#1666](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1666))
- **Project-root discovery** — OMX now resolves the project root by walking to `.omx` instead of a hardcoded directory depth. (PR [#1664](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1664))
- **AGENTS.md preservation on setup refresh** — local `AGENTS.md` content is preserved during auto-update refresh. (PR [#1673](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1673), issue [#1671](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1671))
- **Fresh-session context isolation** — new sessions are isolated from stale task-scoped startup context. (PR [#1634](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1634), issue [#1624](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1624))

#### HUD / worker startup
- **Canonical team phase over stale startup HUD** — HUD prefers the canonical team phase over stale startup state. (PR [#1646](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1646))
- **Wiki Unicode title slugs** — `wiki.titleToSlug` preserves Unicode characters. (PR [#1645](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1645))
- **Worker shell startup command quoting** — `processSpec.command` is properly quoted during worker shell startup. (PR [#1644](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1644))

#### Release workflow / docs
- **Release contributor metadata range** — release contributor metadata stays aligned with the actual release commit range, and the release-body regression test no longer breaks under CI env. (PR [#1639](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1639), issue [#1623](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1623))
- **Doctor readiness clarity** — doctor output now clarifies when setup is done versus when Codex can really run. (PR [#1630](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1630), issue [#1626](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1626))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness docs aligned to `0.13.2`.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-16

Hotfix release for the detached tmux startup regression introduced in `0.13.0`.

### Fixed
- **Detached tmux stdin preservation** — detached leader shells now keep Codex stdin attached during background startup, so `omx --madmax --high` and related detached launch paths no longer exit immediately on macOS/iTerm2-style interactive sessions. (PR [#1631](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1631), issues [#1627](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1627), [#1628](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1628))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness docs aligned to `0.13.1`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-16

Minor release for the new `omx adapt` surface, stronger Ralph / runtime session authority, safer cross-platform launch behavior, and another broad pass over hook, HUD, notification, and release-process correctness.

### Added
- **OMX adapt foundations** — `omx adapt` now exposes OMX-owned adapter foundations for persistent external targets, with read-only probe/status/doctor surfaces, init/envelope output under `.omx/adapters/<target>/...`, planning artifact linkage, and target-specific OpenClaw and Hermes evidence. (PRs [#1600](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1600), [#1599](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1599), [#1598](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1598))
- **Hermes runtime observation** — Hermes adaptation reports ACP, gateway, session-store, and bootstrap evidence without writing into the Hermes runtime. (PR [#1598](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1598))
- **OpenClaw local observation** — OpenClaw adaptation summarizes local config, gateway, hook mapping, and lifecycle bridge evidence while keeping command gateways gated. (PR [#1599](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1599))

### Fixed

#### Ralph / runtime authority / workflow semantics
- **Ralph session authority** — Ralph assignment and tmux Ralph nudges now stay scoped to the activating/current session instead of drifting across concurrent OMX sessions. (PRs [#1604](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1604), [#1591](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1591))
- **Prompt-side Ralph vs PRD CLI startup** — prompt activation no longer pretends to be `omx ralph --prd`, and PRD story validation remains required on the explicit CLI path. (PR [#1608](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1608))
- **Native Stop stability** — Stop handling is stable across session-id drift, permission-seeking handoffs resume automatically, and native hook metadata no longer hijacks routing. (PRs [#1590](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1590), [#1611](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1611); direct commit `4377e1e`)
- **MCP state transport resilience** — resumed duplicate MCP state writers stay alive after reconcile/self-teardown paths. (PR [#1596](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1596))

#### Launch / platform / worktree safety
- **Explore harness resolution** — `omx explore` skips unusable PATH node entries, resolves POSIX Codex shims under sandboxed pnpm-style PATHs, and fails closed before Windows paths hit the POSIX allowlist wrapper. (PRs [#1562](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1562), [#1610](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1610); direct commit `72b1e5d`)
- **Detached leader cleanup** — detached Codex children are terminated when their leader shell exits on signal, with regression coverage for the orphan path. (PR [#1605](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1605))
- **Windows cleanup discovery** — Windows OMX cleanup finds real orphaned servers again. (PR [#1589](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1589))
- **Stale worktree startup** — detached team startup no longer fails just because an old recorded worktree path is missing. (PR [#1582](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1582))

#### Hooks / HUD / notifications
- **HUD active-session binding** — HUD state stays bound to the live OMX session rather than falling back to stale root scope. (PR [#1573](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1573))
- **macOS leader stale polling** — leader stale polling now reduces repeated git probes on macOS, lowering high-CPU polling churn in long-running sessions. (PR [#1619](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1619))
- **Queued startup and dispatch regressions** — Codex startup banners, queued drafts, and dispatch-lock behavior are covered so inbox/worker startup cannot regress silently. (PR [#1595](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1595))
- **Slack mention parsing** — Slack notification mention environment parsing has focused regression coverage. (PR [#1585](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1585))
- **Receiving-agent ownership** — generated guidance now treats safe reversible OMX/runtime operations as the receiving agent's responsibility instead of asking the user to perform ordinary cleanup. (direct commit `76e808e`)

#### Setup / docs / release workflow
- **Wiki setup registration** — `omx setup` installs the shipped wiki skill/config assets consistently. (PR [#1571](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1571))
- **Native hook doctor coverage** — doctor/config output now surfaces missing native-hook coverage before it looks like a broken OMX install. (PR [#1546](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1546))
- **Contribution branch guardrail** — normal contribution guidance now makes `dev` the obvious PR base. (PR [#1567](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1567))

### Changed
- **Release workflow dependency refresh** — GitHub Actions and tooling dependencies are refreshed for the release pipeline and TypeScript/Biome baselines. (PRs [#1575](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1575), [#1576](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1576), [#1577](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1577), [#1578](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1578))
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, release notes, and release-readiness docs aligned to `0.13.0`.

## [0.12.6] - 2026-04-13

Wiki-first knowledge workflows, notification and hook delivery hardening, launch/worktree safety improvements, and automatic closure of explicitly linked issues after `dev` merges across 32 PRs.

### Added
- **OMX wiki workflow** — local markdown wiki storage, ingest/query/lint/refresh flows, wiki MCP server support, CLI parity, and wiki-aware explore integration. (PR [#1481](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1481))
- **Discord job-control primitive** — tracked OMX Discord sessions gain a safe first control layer plus better message/session reuse handling. (PR [#1530](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1530), issue [#1528](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1528))
- **Dev merge issue auto-close** — merged PRs into `dev` can now automatically close explicitly linked local issues. (PR [#1541](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1541), issue [#1540](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1540))

### Fixed

- **Managed-session hook stability** — cwd alias mismatches no longer break managed tmux ownership or hook session logic. (PR [#1495](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1495))
- **Ralph / release-readiness follow-up scoping** — stale session-scoped suppressions and generic stop residue no longer hijack unrelated flows. (PRs [#1496](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1496), [#1514](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1514), issues [#1494](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1494), [#1513](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1513))
- **Notification noise reduction** — duplicate lifecycle broadcasts, stale follow-up alerts, metadata false positives, and post-stop keyword replay are suppressed. (PRs [#1518](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1518), [#1520](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1520), [#1526](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1526), [#1529](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1529))
- **Dead-session HUD residue** — stale HUD state is cleared before follow-up tooling reads it. (PR [#1539](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1539), issue [#1538](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1538))

#### Launch / setup / operator safety
- **Reusable worktree dependency bootstrap** — launch worktrees can reuse safe parent `node_modules` instead of forcing fresh installs. (PR [#1510](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1510), issue [#1507](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1507))

### Added
- **Current-task baseline branch guardrails** — `omx team` now tracks a baseline branch per task so workers stay anchored to the correct starting point. (PR [#1419](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1419), issue [#1407](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1407))
- **Approved multi-workflow overlaps** — canonical state now accepts approved workflow overlaps without corrupting session visibility. (PR [#1427](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1427))
- **Windows ps fallback for notifications** — `omx notify` tolerates missing `ps` on Windows via a graceful process-list fallback. (PR [#1457](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1457))

### Fixed

#### Team startup / shutdown
- **Stalled-worker startup recovery** — team launches now stay recoverable when early workers stall during startup instead of hanging the whole boot sequence. (PR [#1444](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1444))
- **Cross-session stale root team Stop** — root team Stop no longer blocks sessions that did not originate the team. (PR [#1451](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1451))
- **Linux tmux startup handoff and shutdown persistence** — startup handoff and shutdown-state persistence are now correct on Linux tmux paths. (PR [#1438](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1438))
- **session.json ownership tightened** — stale session pointers can no longer revive the wrong runtime state; fallback semantics are now explicit. (PR [#1447](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1447))

#### Multi-skill / workflow state
- **Planning state preserved in mixed prompt routing** — `ralplan` / `ralph` planning state is no longer dropped when a multi-skill prompt is re-routed mid-flow. (PR [#1471](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1471), issue [#1353](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1353))
- **Workflow handoff correctness** — malformed workflow-state objects are now rejected during reconciliation; stale workflow state can no longer block real handoffs. (PR [#1442](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1442))
- **Flaky hook and HUD state scope** — CI-aligned session-scoped hook contract; hooks and HUD no longer drift to stale session scope. (PR [#1446](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1446))

#### Windows
- **Split-pane shutdown leader-pane targeting** — stale leader pane ID no longer misdirects split-pane shutdown signals. (PR [#1470](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1470), issue [#1353](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1353))
- **Native psmux worker startup path** — Windows workers now start on the resolved Codex launcher path, not a stale entrypoint. (PR [#1469](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1469), issue [#1361](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1361))
- **MCP orphan cleanup** — Windows MCP child processes no longer survive parent shutdown. (PR [#1437](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1437), issue [#1435](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1435))
- **Retired team MCP config repair** — `omx doctor` and the launch path now realign retired team MCP config entries on upgrade. (PR [#1436](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1436))

#### tmux / macOS / shell
- **Detached tmux launch cwd** — detached tmux panes now start in the requested working directory, not the caller's cwd. (PR [#1468](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1468), issue [#1374](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1374))
- **Worker cwd on shell launch** — supported shells (zsh, bash) preserve the worker cwd when launching team panes. (PR [#1460](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1460))
- **Homebrew zsh normalization** — macOS Homebrew zsh paths are now normalized before tmux pane launch so panes inherit the correct shell. (PR [#1462](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1462), issue [#1439](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1439))
- **tmux PID resolution hardening** — startup PID resolution is more robust; copy-mode is cleaned up after attach. (PR [#1459](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1459))

#### HUD / session anchoring
- **HUD state session scope** — HUD state is now anchored to the active OMX session; cross-session HUD drift is eliminated. (PR [#1453](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1453))
- **Native session-id drift** — native session-id drift no longer hides team transport failures from the HUD. (PR [#1458](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1458))

#### deep-interview
- **Stop auto-continuation in intent-first phase** — native Stop no longer fires auto-continuation while deep-interview is in its ask-user questioning phase; that phase is now treated as planning for stall detection. (PR [#1473](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1473), issue [#1472](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1472))

#### Explore harness
- **rustup shim without default toolchain** — `omx explore` now emits a clear actionable error instead of surfacing a raw rustup message when `cargo` exists as a shim but no default toolchain is configured. (`src/cli/explore.ts`)

#### Hooks / auth / notify
- **Stop-hook Ralph session scoping** — Ralph stop-hook no longer leaks across sessions; session authority is enforced before gating. (PR [#1466](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1466), issue [#1461](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1461))
- **Auto-nudge authorization leaks** — read-only and planning flows no longer receive tool-use authorization nudges intended for full-execution flows. (PR [#1434](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1434), issue [#1416](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1416))
- **Notify hooks track live teams** — notify hooks stay aligned when coarse team state drifts between turns. (PR [#1428](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1428))
- **Launcher-backed MCP restart stall** — long-lived MCP server restart stalls are now bounded so they do not block team recovery indefinitely. (PR [#1408](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1408))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, and release notes aligned to `0.12.5`.

### Docs
- Removed stale `prompts/` invocation guidance from README. (PR [#1417](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1417))

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-09

MCP-CLI parity surface, HUD recovery and reconciliation hardening, native-hook and team-runtime stability fixes, and state operations module extraction.

### Added
- **MCP-CLI parity surface** — new `omx state`, `omx notepad`, `omx project-memory`, `omx trace`, and `omx code-intel` CLI subcommands expose MCP server tools via CLI, enabling scriptable access without MCP transport. (`src/cli/mcp-parity.ts`, `src/cli/state.ts`)
- **HUD reconciliation module** — new `src/hud/reconcile.ts` auto-reconciles HUD pane state across session boundaries.
- **Shared HUD tmux helpers** — tmux pane management (`parseTmuxPaneSnapshot`, `createHudWatchPane`, `killTmuxPane`, etc.) extracted to `src/hud/tmux.ts` for shared use by CLI and reconciliation.
- **State operations module** — new `src/state/operations.ts` provides read/write/clear/list-active/get-status for mode state, backing both the MCP state server and the new CLI parity surface.
- **Path traversal guard** — `src/utils/paths.ts` adds safety utilities for path validation.

### Fixed
- **HUD recovery via OMX CLI entry** — prompt-submit recovery now restores the real HUD process instead of silently skipping it. (PRs [#1413](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1413), [#1414](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1414))
- **User-owned Codex hooks preserved** — `omx setup` no longer clobbers user-written hooks when refreshing OMX wrappers.
- **HUD prompt-submit layout churn** — prompt-submit autosizing stopped while preserving recovery behavior.
- **Duplicate native-hook continuations** — stale Ralph state and unknown `$tokens` no longer trigger duplicate hook continuations.
- **Stale team worktree cleanup** — `startTeam()` detects and cleans stale worktrees at launch. (PR [#1382](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1382), issue [#1354](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/1354))
- **Stale stop-hook deep-interview suppression** — deep-interview suppression after skill-state canonicalization no longer persists beyond its session.
- **Native Stop stale blocker** — Stop no longer trusts stale blocker skill state.
- **MCP transport death recovery** — transport death no longer stalls team recovery.
- **Clean team shutdown** — explicit shutdown without weakening dirty-worktree safety.
- **Detached session trap** — session cleanup only fires on normal exit (`status < 128`), not on signals; trap narrowed to `EXIT` only.
- **CI hang prevention** — teardown dead-time reduced; CI hangs no longer stall root-cause work. (PR [#1405](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1405))

### Changed
- **State CLI routing** — `omx state` routed consistently through the CLI via `src/cli/state.ts`.
- **Tmux session name truncation** — smarter truncation preserves session token when name exceeds 120 chars.
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, and release notes aligned to `0.12.4`.

### Verified
- `npm run build` ✅
- `npx biome lint src/` ✅ (435 files)
- `npm test` — 3068/3070 passing. The 2 failures (`state.test.ts: dispatch request store keeps failed requests failed`, `runtime.test.ts: sendWorkerMessage keeps failed hook receipts failed`) are pre-existing on `main` (commit `3a193cfb`) and not regressions introduced by this release.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-08

Follow-up patch release for the `v0.12.2..v0.12.3` train: `$team` prompt-routing correctness and duplicate team launch teardown. This ships PR [#1364](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1364) that was intended for `0.12.2` but finished its conflict resolution after the `0.12.2` cut.

### Fixed
- **`$team` keyword prompt routing** — `UserPromptSubmit` detection of `$team` now seeds root `team-state.json` and nudges operators toward `omx team ...` / `omx team --help` instead of silently misrouting the prompt. (PR [#1364](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1364))
- **Duplicate active same-name team launches** — `startTeam` now rejects duplicate active same-name team launches with a `team_name_conflict` error before mutating team state or provisioning worktrees, so the existing team config and tasks stay intact. (PR [#1364](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1364))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, and release notes are aligned to `0.12.3`.

### Verified
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run smoke:packed-install`

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-08

Patch release for the `v0.12.1..v0.12.2` train: Windows team worker boot and shutdown hardening, postLaunch mode-state shutdown-race recovery, canonical HUD skill-state visibility, and team state preservation on monitor-driven exits.

### Fixed
- **Windows split-pane shutdown safety** — `omx team shutdown --force` no longer kills the leader pane on native Windows + psmux split-pane sessions by skipping the process-tree prekill step when leader/client ancestry overlaps. (PR [#1358](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1358))
- **PostLaunch mode-state shutdown race** — empty or truncated mode-state JSON left by concurrent writers during session exit is now recovered into a minimal inactive record instead of crashing cleanup; structurally complete malformed JSON is warned but left untouched. (PR [#1360](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1360))
- **Windows psmux worker boot** — native Windows team workers now launch through an explicit PowerShell path instead of being routed through POSIX `/bin/sh -lc`, which caused workers to never report ready. (PR [#1362](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1362))
- **Stale HUD workflow badges** — canonical session-scoped skill-active state now drives HUD badge visibility, suppressing stale root-only mode badges that outlived their session while preserving backward compatibility for legacy single-skill readers. (PR [#1367](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1367))
- **Team state silently deleted** — monitor-detected terminal and failure conditions in `runtime-cli` no longer trigger shutdown cleanup; team state is preserved until operators explicitly request shutdown. (PR [#1369](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1369))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, and release notes are aligned to `0.12.2`.

### Verified
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run smoke:packed-install`

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-07

Patch release for the `v0.12.0..v0.12.1` train: team-runtime hygiene, launch/cleanup follow-through, notify-fallback hardening, and release-collateral sync.

### Fixed
- **Machine-readable team status output** — leader mailbox pruning no longer re-issues duplicate delivered-message bridge calls, so `omx team status --json` stays parseable instead of leaking mailbox-delivery stderr noise.
- **Interactive worker PID capture** — team startup now resolves worker PIDs from the actual pane id and persists them into worker metadata for diagnostics and cleanup.
- **Launch-safe orphan cleanup** — stale OMX MCP cleanup preserves live launcher/session ancestry instead of reaping processes that still belong to the active tree.
- **Notify-fallback log growth** — once-mode fallback watcher logs now rotate instead of growing silently on long-lived runs.

### Changed
- **Direct leader launch by default** — outside tmux, OMX now launches the leader directly unless the operator explicitly requests detached tmux behavior.
- **Prompt collateral tightening** — the information-architect prompt is slimmer and the `0.12.1` release/readiness collateral now matches the actual patch scope.
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release body, and release notes are aligned to `0.12.1`.

### Verified

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-06

Minor release for native Codex hook ownership, first-party Bash pre/post tool guidance, runtime/team delivery hardening, and workflow-doc refresh after `0.11.13`.

### Added
- **First-party native Bash pre/post hooks** — OMX now ships documented `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` Bash guidance and supporting native-hook wiring so operators can extend tool lifecycle behavior without relying on ad hoc shell glue. (PR [#1316](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1316))

### Fixed
- **Native hook ownership + continuity** — repo-local native Codex hook ownership now survives session-start and stop-state continuity more reliably, and setup/uninstall flows align with the landed runtime contract. (PRs [#1306](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1306), [#1314](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1314))
- **Team/runtime delivery + steering reliability** — mailbox delivery, next-action steering, false handoff signals, persist-error surfacing, and diagnostics-without-tsconfig behavior are hardened across the live operator path. (PRs [#1293](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1293), [#1294](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1294), [#1300](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1300), [#1303](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1303), [#1304](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1304), [#1305](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1305))
- **Windows / tmux / launcher supervision** — detached launches, shift-enter handling, PowerShell command resolution, and tmux child binding stay more predictable across platform-specific edges. (PRs [#1265](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1265), [#1273](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1273), [#1275](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1275), [#1282](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1282))

### Changed
- **Quality-first guidance defaults** — generated AGENTS/prompt guidance now leans harder on intent-deepening, evidence, and verification sequencing instead of compact-first satisficing. (PR [#1281](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1281))
- **Docs + localization refresh** — README variants live under `docs/readme/`, Ukrainian OpenClaw/docs coverage is added, and user-facing docs are refreshed around the modern deep-interview → ralplan → team/ralph workflow. (PRs [#1270](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1270), [#1308](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1308))
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release notes, QA/readiness notes, and release body are aligned to `0.12.0`.

## [0.11.13] - 2026-04-04

Patch release for team/runtime delivery integrity, busy-leader nudge handling, release hygiene fixes, and Windows/worktree reliability follow-through after `0.11.12`.

### Fixed
- **Leader + mailbox delivery integrity** — team leader mailbox delivery stays reliable across runtime/CLI seams, false team-coordination signals are suppressed during runtime handoff, and busy Codex leader panes can now receive queued nudges instead of silently deferring them. (PRs [#1217](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1217), [#1223](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1223), [#1224](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1224))
- **Windows / tmux worktree supervision** — leader activity polling, HUD targeting, and Windows worktree/session handling stay stable across detached launches and worktree checkouts. (PRs [#1212](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1212), [#1213](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1213), [#1191](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1191))
- **Workflow hygiene around deep-interview + uninstall paths** — fallback nudges honor active deep-interview input locks, uninstall warns cleanly about legacy skills, and shutdown cleanup reaps detached worker descendants more reliably. (PRs [#1203](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1203), [#1193](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1193), [#1204](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1204))

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, release notes, and release body are aligned to `0.11.13`.
- **Release branch repair** — the accidental placeholder corruption in `src/hooks/__tests__/notify-fallback-watcher.test.ts` is restored before the patch cut so the release branch builds cleanly again.

## [0.11.12] - 2026-04-02

Patch release for Windows flicker reductions, team/runtime seam cleanup, safer auto-nudge hygiene, cross-platform Node test execution, and workflow-doc alignment after `0.11.11`.

### Fixed
- **Windows terminal flicker reductions** — `windowsHide` coverage now spans the remaining child-process launch paths, and filesystem-based git info reads avoid the extra Windows console flash path. (PRs [#1104](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1104), [#1107](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1107), [#1123](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1123))
- **Team/runtime seam cleanup** — team cwd metadata now resolves canonically from `manifest.v2`, and dispatch/mailbox transitions no longer straddle the remaining dual-write seam gaps. (PRs [#1114](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1114), [#1126](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1126))
- **Auto-nudge / tmux session hygiene** — stale-turn auto-nudges stay disarmed after cooldown, readiness checks tolerate prompt scroll-off, and nudges stay limited to OMX-managed tmux sessions. (PRs [#1091](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1091), [#1093](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1093), [#1119](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1119))

### Changed
- **Cross-platform Node test runner** — Node test execution can now enumerate compiled test files without depending on POSIX `find`, making the release/CI test path portable across platforms. (PR [#1122](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1122))
- **Workflow docs standardized** — onboarding/docs now consistently steer users through deep-interview -> ralplan -> team/ralph, with linked legacy skill roots resolved through one canonical path. (PRs [#1128](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1128), [#1132](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1132))
- **Release metadata sync** — Node/Cargo package metadata, lockfiles, changelog, and release collateral are aligned to `0.11.12` for the patch cut.

### Verified
- `cargo check --workspace`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `node --test dist/cli/__tests__/version-sync-contract.test.js`
- release-workflow inline version-sync check from `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `npm run test:node:cross-platform`
- `npm run smoke:packed-install`

## [0.11.10] - 2026-03-30

Patch release for approved handoff alias parsing hardening and release metadata synchronization after `0.11.9`.

### Fixed
- **Approved handoff alias parsing regression coverage** — planning artifact tests now protect single-quoted approved launch hints for both `$ralph` and `$team`, preventing quoting-form drift in execution handoff parsing. (direct commit `e08a746`)

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node and Cargo package metadata are bumped to `0.11.10` for this patch release.
- **Release collateral refresh** — release notes and `RELEASE_BODY.md` are refreshed for the `0.11.10` cut.

### Verified

## [0.11.9] - 2026-03-25

Patch release for deeper deep-interview / ralplan coordination, setup repair, and safer live team supervision after `0.11.8`.

### Added
- **Live ralplan state visibility** — consensus planning now exposes observable runtime state so the pipeline, HUD, and attached guidance can reflect active ralplan progress more faithfully. (PR [#1060](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1060))
- **Analyze skill trace refresh** — the shipped analyze skill now follows the OmC trace methodology with restored execution-policy contract wording, improving investigation guidance. (direct commits `fa01cb5`, `c0a0e1a`)

### Fixed
- **Deep-interview lock suppresses tmux-pane nudges** — active deep-interview lock state now blocks fallback tmux-pane nudges, and planning handoff applies stronger deep-interview pressure before execution can proceed. (PRs [#1062](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1062), [#1058](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1058))
- **Setup stays compatible with Codex-managed TUI configs** — rerunning setup no longer rebreaks managed TUI sections, while explore-routing defaults remain aligned with setup guidance. (PRs [#1048](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1048), [#1053](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1053))
- **HUD stateful-mode visibility restored** — active stateful modes are visible in the HUD again instead of disappearing during live sessions. (PR [#1055](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1055))
- **Live worker supervision remains resilient** — fallback orchestration now stays alive while team workers are still active, and team flows auto-accept the Claude bypass prompt when required. (PR [#1043](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/1043), direct commit `3f2eb67`)

### Changed

## [0.11.8] - 2026-03-23

Hotfix release for deep-interview nudge suppression and duplicate fresh-leader nudge prevention.

### Fixed
- **Deep-interview nudge suppression** — when deep-interview state is present, notify-hook and the fallback watcher now suppress leader nudges, worker-idle nudges, Ralph continue-steers, and auto-nudges so the interview can proceed without automated interruptions.
- **Fresh leader dedupe hardening** — fallback watcher leader nudges now stay stale-only, while notify-hook regression coverage proves the same fresh mailbox message does not re-trigger repeated leader nudges.

### Changed
- **Release metadata sync** — Node and Cargo package metadata are bumped to `0.11.8` for this hotfix release.

### Verified
- `cargo check --workspace`
- `npm run build`
- `node --test --test-reporter=spec dist/hooks/__tests__/notify-hook-auto-nudge.test.js`

- `node --test --test-reporter=spec dist/hooks/__tests__/notify-fallback-watcher.test.js`

## [0.11.7] - 2026-03-23

Patch release for degraded-state auto-nudge recovery, tighter team control-plane correctness, and release metadata consistency across the `v0.11.6..dev` hotfix train.

### Fixed
- **Watcher / dispatch recovery** — team dispatch now resolves the shared runtime binary correctly, fallback watcher cooldowns debounce across processes, persisted dispatch IDs stay aligned with runtime bridge request IDs, and successful tmux fallback delivery recovers requests back to `notified`. (PRs #1002, #1004, #1020, #1021)
- **Leader nudge accuracy** — completed or foreign-session teams no longer resurface as stale leader nudges, leader control remains mailbox-only, and advancing worker turn counts count as progress before a stall is declared. (PRs #1001, #1023)
- **Linked Ralph + team lifecycle** — linked Ralph now stays alive for the full team run, prompt-mode launches skip the bridge correctly, duplicate leader mailbox sends are deduplicated, and missing-team cleanup now finalizes linked Ralph instead of leaving it active indefinitely. (PRs #1011, #1012, #1013, #1017, #1025)

### Changed
- **Generated defaults and prompt guidance** — the default status line now includes `weekly-limit`, exact `gpt-5.4-mini` worker/subagent launches get a narrower prompt seam, and AGENTS guidance now prefers the current frontier default over stale explicit child-model pins. (PRs #1009, #1016, #1018)
- **Release metadata sync** — Node and Cargo release metadata are realigned to `0.11.7`, keeping the repo version-sync contract intact for the release branch. (release follow-up commit `c4c5b75`)

### Verified
- **Commit-window review** — parallel module review across `main...dev` found `3` main-only merge commits (`#995`, `#997`, `#1000`) but no main-only patch content after cherry-pick elimination, so the shipped release delta is entirely on the `dev` side.
- **Targeted hook + watcher regression suite** — `notify-fallback-watcher` and `notify-hook auto-nudge` pass with the degraded-state coverage (`49/49` passing).
- **Real tmux smoke for degraded auto-nudge** — a live Codex pane received `yes, proceed [OMX_TMUX_INJECT]` from the fallback watcher after a 5s stalled-turn window with only HUD state available.
- **Real tmux smoke for Ralph anti-spam** — two back-to-back fallback watcher ticks did not emit repeated `Ralph loop active continue` sends; the persisted state stayed in cooldown (`startup_cooldown`).

## [0.11.6] - 2026-03-21

Patch release for Ralph continue-steer restart throttling.

### Fixed
- **Ralph continue-steer restart throttling** — fallback watcher cooldown anchors now survive restarts and malformed persisted timestamps, preventing repeated continue-steer injection spam after Ralph resumes. (PR [#998](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/998), closes [#996](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/996))

## [0.11.5] - 2026-03-21

Hotfix release for stale leader nudge false-positives and README onboarding clarity.

### Fixed
- **False-positive leader stale nudges** — leader activity freshness check now considers any recent leader activity, preventing spurious stale nudges when the leader is actively working. (PR [#993](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/993))

### Changed
- **README onboarding refocused** — README now centers onboarding around the real default OMX path for clearer first-run guidance. (PR [#992](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/992))

## [0.11.4] - 2026-03-20


Hotfix release for team worker delivery regressions.

### Fixed
- **Packaged watcher entrypoint resolution** — team fallback watcher startup and one-shot flush paths now resolve shipped `dist/scripts/*.js` entrypoints instead of nonexistent top-level `scripts/*.js`, restoring worker message delivery and state-change delivery in packed installs.
- **CI smoke coverage for packaged watcher paths** — smoke CI now exercises the packaged watcher path-resolution contract so future release builds catch this class of regression before shipping.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Explore/sparkshell fallback hardening** — hardened sparkshell fallback behavior, missing-native-manifest handling, and release-asset/native-cache lookup so packaged installs fail more cleanly and recover more predictably. (commit `dc83dfd`, `7aee91d`)
- **Sparkshell summary behavior is more stable under noisy output** — summary reasoning was constrained and stress coverage added so long-output summaries stay more predictable and preserve salient facts. (PR [#781](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/781), commit `a653376`)
- **CLI/help/runtime polish around the new stack** — local `ask`/`hud` help routing, HUD branch/config handling, Windows Codex command probing, and team runtime lifecycle/cleanup paths were tightened during the same release window. (PRs [#785](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/785), [#786](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/786), [#788](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/788), [#793](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/793))

## [0.8.13] - 2026-03-11

19 non-merge commits from `main..dev`. Contributors: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo), [@HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun), [@gobylor](https://github.com/gobylor).

### Added
- **Top-level `omx resume` command** — added `omx resume` passthrough so OMX mirrors `codex resume`, with CLI/help/docs coverage. (PR [#752](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/752) — @gobylor)
- **Team allocation and conservative rebalance policy seams** — team startup assignment is now lane-aware, and runtime monitoring can safely reassign reclaimed pending work to eligible idle workers without rewriting the claim model. (PR [#761](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/761) — @HaD0Yun)

### Changed
- **Team policy manifest boundaries are clearer** — persisted transport/runtime policy is now separated from lifecycle governance so nested-team checks, approval/delegation gates, and shutdown cleanup rules come from the authoritative runtime side. (PR [#753](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/753), issue [#746](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/746))
- **Shared tmux stall heuristics now drive both hook and runtime paths** — common stall/bootstrap/ready/active-task detection moved into a shared engine reused by notify-hook dispatch/guard logic and the team tmux session runtime. (PR [#758](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/758), issue [#732](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/732))
- **Team-mode docs and guidance were refreshed** — README copy now positions OMX more clearly around Team Mode, and the root guidance wording was tightened for direct execution and evidence-backed verification. (PR [#765](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/765), commit [`5ced66d`](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/commit/5ced66db873b2cf729f66075062df3c2a8599357))

### Fixed
- **Fallback team delivery and stale-alert latency** — faster fallback watcher cadence, leader nudge evaluation on fallback ticks, and a larger default dispatch ack budget reduce lag in team message delivery and stale alerts. (PR [#739](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/739), issue [#738](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/738))
- **Invalid Codex TOML detection in `omx doctor`** — doctor now flags malformed `~/.codex/config.toml` with a clearer duplicate-table hint. (PR [#740](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/740), related issue [#486](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/486))
- **Linked Team Ralph lifecycle synchronization** — `omx team ralph` now establishes linked Ralph state on launch, propagates linked terminal cancellation directly from runtime transitions, and keeps continue-steer alive when the launcher parent exits while Ralph work is still active. (PR [#749](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/749), issue [#742](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/742); PR [#750](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/750), issue [#743](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/743); PR [#751](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/751))
- **Team worker and leader nudges are more actionable** — auto-nudge follow-up phrases are detected more reliably, leader nudges now derive next actions from live team state, mailbox guidance is more explicit, and stale “keep polling” wording was replaced with orchestration guidance. (PR [#754](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/754); PR [#759](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/759), issue [#759](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/759); PR [#763](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/763); PR [#766](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/766))
- **HUD cleanup during team shutdown** — interactive shutdown now tears down the HUD pane cleanly to avoid stale panes across rapid relaunch cycles. (PR [#764](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/764), issue [#764](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/764))
- **CLI startup no longer eagerly loads `doctor`** — the `doctor` command is now lazy-loaded so unrelated CLI invocations avoid unnecessary work. (commit [`2503d95`](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/commit/2503d9528d175a032bbc247f61137c5daf547923))

12 non-merge commits from `v0.8.11..dev`. Contributors: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo), [@HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun), [@gobylor](https://github.com/gobylor).

### Added
- **Team orchestrator brain and executor lane split** — team workflow now uses dedicated `team-orchestrator` and `team-executor` agent roles for clearer separation of planning and execution concerns. (PR [#715](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/715))
- **Session history search command** — `omx session-history search` (alias: `omx sh search`) enables full-text search across command history, prompts, and tool interactions with multi-field matching and interactive filtering. (PR [#724](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/724))
- **Team idle and stall read APIs** — `omx team api` now exposes `idle-read` and `stall-read` operations for programmatic monitoring of team worker states. (PR [#720](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/720))
- **Ralph periodic active continue steer** — Ralph mode now periodically prompts active agents to continue when progress has stalled, reducing idle wait times. (PR [#733](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/733))
- **Team leader status monitoring hints** — improved leader-side status hints for better visibility into team member progress and stalled states. (PR [#734](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/734))

### Changed
- **Low-confidence analysis prompts stay single-lane** — team decomposition now keeps analysis prompts in a single lane when confidence is low, preventing fragmentation of uncertain work. (PR [#726](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/726))

### Fixed
- **Windows psmux detached launch stability** — resolved process detachment issues when launching team workers on Windows. (PR [#725](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/725))
- **Skip tmux bootstrap when tmux unavailable** — graceful fallback when tmux is not installed or not in PATH. (PR [#722](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/722) — @gobylor)
- **Stalled team leader nudge before stale gate** — team leaders now receive proactive nudges before hitting stale detection thresholds. (PR [#729](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/729))

### Reverted
- **Experimental Rust CLI parity harness** — commits #728 and #730 were reverted from dev to maintain TypeScript CLI stability. (PR [#736](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/736))

## [0.8.11] - 2026-03-10

Generated from the latest merged `dev` runtime/model-default work and validated on `dev` before release.

### Added
- **Additive team event-query APIs** — `omx team api` now exposes dedicated event-query operations so team runtime signals can be consumed more structurally. (PR [#714](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/714))
- **Explicit model-default contract** — runtime/docs/tests now align around the intended main/spark default model behavior (`gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`). (PR [#718](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/718))

### Changed
- **Team prompt decomposition is less brittle for prose prompts** — natural-language task prompts are no longer fragmented into pathological subtasks as easily. (PR [#712](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/712))

### Fixed
- **Shell-pane notification cleanup after terminal team states** — team notify injection now stays out of shell panes after completion. (PR [#668](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/668))
- **Clawhip lifecycle event noise reduction** — operational event emission is quieter while preserving needed visibility. (PR [#713](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/713))
- **Team runtime hardening across startup/worktree/idle-launch-arg paths** — includes the merged fixes from PRs [#696](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/696), [#697](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/697), [#700](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/700), [#707](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/707), [#708](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/708), and [#711](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/711).
- **Release gate stability for setup refresh tests** — setup AGENTS overwrite coverage now stays non-interactive under test so the release gate no longer hangs on a model-upgrade prompt.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-03-09

5 non-merge commits from `v0.8.9..dev`. Contributors: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo), [@HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun).

### Added
- **Release-critical regression coverage and test-environment isolation** — expanded CLI auto-update regression coverage across success, decline, failure, and already-up-to-date paths, and hardened CLI/OpenClaw integration suites against ambient `CODEX_HOME` leakage so release validation stays deterministic. (direct commit `aedd068` — @Yeachan-Heo)

### Changed
- **Root prompt contracts now bias more explicitly toward direct execution and evidence-backed verification** — tightened the top-level `AGENTS.md` / template contracts and simplified core prompt surfaces while preserving workflow, team, and verification guarantees. (PR [#646](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/646) — @HaD0Yun)
- **Local development artifacts are now ignored by git** — `.codex/` and `coverage/` are ignored to avoid committing local session state and generated coverage data. (direct commit `3149747` — @Yeachan-Heo)

### Fixed
- **Auto-update now refreshes OMX setup immediately after a successful global install** — successful `omx` self-updates now force a setup refresh so prompts, skills, and `AGENTS.md` stay in sync without a separate manual refresh. (PR [#648](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/648) — @Yeachan-Heo)
- **tmux Enter submission is more reliable in alternate-screen UIs** — added a settle delay before the first `C-m` submit and mirrored that protection in the hook extensibility tmux submission path. (PR [#649](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/649) — @Yeachan-Heo, fixes [#647](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/647))

## [0.8.9] - 2026-03-08

2 non-merge commits from `v0.8.8..dev`. Contributor: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo).

### Changed
- **Team worker startup now uses per-role instruction surfaces end-to-end** — routed worker roles now persist into live team config/identity, compose per-worker startup `AGENTS.md` files from the resolved role prompt, and continue to apply role-based default reasoning unless explicit launch overrides are present. (PR [#643](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/643))

### Fixed
- **Scaled task bootstrap now persists canonical task state before worker handoff** — dynamic scale-up writes new tasks through canonical team state first, preserving stable task ids/owners/roles for worker inboxes and role resolution instead of reconstructing synthetic task metadata during bootstrap.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-08

5 non-merge commits from `main..dev`. Contributor: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo).

### Added
- **Anti-slop workflow and catalog wiring** — added the anti-slop workflow contract to root/template guidance, introduced a dedicated `ai-slop-cleaner` skill, and updated catalog manifests/tests so the new workflow is part of the generated skill surface. (PR [#634](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/634))
- **Per-teammate reasoning-effort allocation for team runs** — team orchestration can now resolve reasoning effort per worker, with updated runtime/model-contract behavior plus regression coverage for runtime, tmux-session, and model selection paths. (PR [#642](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/642))

### Changed
- **Team launch/model contracts were tightened** — worker launch args, scaling paths, tmux session handling, and README / skill guidance were adjusted so teammate-specific reasoning effort is propagated more consistently during team execution.

### Fixed
- **Deep-interview auto-approval injection is now lock-protected** — keyword detection and notify-hook auto-nudge paths were hardened so deep-interview auto-approval injection stays bounded, with expanded regression coverage around notify-hook modules and keyword routing. (PR [#637](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/637))
- **Published npm bin path normalization** — normalized the package bin path contract and updated the package-bin regression test to keep the published `omx` entrypoint aligned. (PR [#638](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/638))
- **Worker role reservation remains team-only** — prompt-guidance contract enforcement now reserves the worker role for team mode explicitly, backed by routing regression coverage.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-03-08

12 non-merge commits from `v0.8.6..dev`. Contributors: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo), [@HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun), [@marlocarlo](https://github.com/marlocarlo).

### Added
- **Prompt-guidance contract docs and reusable fragments** — added a first-class prompt-guidance contract document, reusable guidance fragments, a sync script, and shared contract test helpers so root instructions, templates, and prompts can stay aligned more systematically. (PR [#620](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/620) — @Yeachan-Heo)
- **Team hardening benchmark and deeper runtime/worktree coverage** — added a dedicated hardening benchmark plus broader runtime, state, worktree, and end-to-end regression coverage for expired-claim recovery and worker hygiene. (PR [#624](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/624) — @HaD0Yun)
- **Centralized MCP stdio lifecycle bootstrap** — state, memory, code-intel, trace, and team MCP servers now share a common `autoStartStdioMcpServer` helper and a dedicated lifecycle regression suite for idle teardown. (PR [#626](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/626), [#627](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/627) — @Yeachan-Heo)
- **Package-bin contract coverage for global installs** — added an explicit contract test to keep the published npm bin path aligned with global `omx` installation behavior. (PR [#633](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/633) — @Yeachan-Heo)

### Changed
- **Prompt surfaces were normalized around contract-driven XML structure** — prompt guidance validation was centralized, shared fragments were extracted, all agent prompts were migrated from Markdown-style headings to XML-tag structure, and the 2-layer orchestrator/role-prompt model was clarified across docs, templates, and config generation. (PR [#619](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/619), [#623](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/623) — @HaD0Yun)
- **Fast-path agent reasoning defaults were rebalanced** — analyst, planner, and related fast-lane agent defaults were tuned downward to better match their intended operating posture.

### Fixed
- **Windows native startup and tmux capability detection** — OMX now checks tmux capability instead of hard-blocking on `win32`, supports `psmux`, uses Windows-appropriate command resolution where needed, and documents the platform setup path more clearly. (PR [#616](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/616) — @marlocarlo)
- **Leader-only orchestration boundaries in prompt surfaces** — worker-facing and role-specific prompts now preserve leader orchestration responsibilities more explicitly, with regression coverage for the boundary contract. (PR [#625](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/625) — @HaD0Yun)
- **npm global-install bin contract** — corrected the published `omx` bin path entry in `package.json` and locked it down with a dedicated contract test for packed tarballs and global installation behavior. (PR [#633](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/633) — @Yeachan-Heo)

## [0.8.6] - 2026-03-07

4 non-merge commits from `main..dev`. Contributor: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo).

### Added
- **Event-aware team waiting and canonical event normalization** — team runtime/state handling now includes additive `wake_on=event` / `after_event_id` waiting in `omx_run_team_wait`, shared event normalization/cursor helpers, canonical event typing across runtime/state/API layers, and new `omx team await <team-name>` CLI support. Runtime now emits `worker_state_changed` while preserving legacy `worker_idle` compatibility. (PR [#609](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/609) — @Yeachan-Heo)
- **GPT-5.4 prompt-guidance rollout across core prompt surfaces** — root/template `AGENTS.md`, executor/planner/verifier prompts, generated `developer_instructions`, and regression coverage were updated to encode compact output defaults, low-risk follow-through, localized task-update overrides, and dependency-aware tool persistence more explicitly. (PR [#611](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/611) — @Yeachan-Heo, addresses [#608](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/608))
- **GPT-5.4 prompt-guidance expansion across the wider prompt catalog and execution-heavy skills** — the same guidance was extended across the remaining agent prompts plus execution-heavy skills including `analyze`, `autopilot`, `plan`, `ralph`, `ralplan`, `team`, `ultraqa`, `code-review`, `security-review`, and `build-fix`, with scenario-focused regression coverage added for prompt catalogs, wave-two guidance, and skill contracts. (PR [#612](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/612) — @Yeachan-Heo, follow-up to [#611](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/611))

### Fixed
- **Leader follow-up, watcher drain visibility, and idle/nudge coordination** — team leader follow-up behavior was hardened without repurposing worker-only nudges; watcher/dispatch drain liveness is now surfaced more clearly in runtime/state paths, with stronger regression coverage for event-mode wait, dispatch dedupe, all-workers-idle, and leader notification flows. (PR [#609](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/609))
- **`team-ops` gateway contract regression** — removed an accidental `teamEventLogPath` re-export so the strict `team-ops` contract remains stable after the event-aware waiting changes. (PR [#610](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/610))

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-06

7 non-merge commits from `v0.8.4..dev`. Contributors: [@Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo), [@HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun), [@sjals93](https://github.com/sjals93).

### Added
- **Posture-aware agent routing** — agents now carry Sisyphus-style posture metadata (`frontier-orchestrator`, `deep-worker`, `fast-lane`) that separates role, reasoning tier, and operating style. Native agent configs include `## OMX Posture Overlay`, `## Model-Class Guidance`, and `## OMX Agent Metadata` sections. (PR [#588](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/588), [#592](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/592) — @HaD0Yun)
- **Maintainers section** added to README with @Yeachan-Heo and @HaD0Yun.

### Fixed
- **Windows ESM import crash** — `bin/omx.js` now converts absolute paths to `file://` URLs before `import()`, fixing `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` on Windows. (PR [#589](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/589) — @sjals93, fixes [#557](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/557))
- **tmux capture-pane history flag** — replaced invalid `-l` flag with the correct `-S` negative-offset form so `capture-pane` actually returns recent output. (PR [#593](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/593), fixes [#591](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/issues/591))
- **Legacy model alias cleanup** — removed stale `gpt-5.3-codex` / `o3` references from 15 prompt files and runtime agent metadata generation, preventing confusion when posture routing is active. (part of PR [#592](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex/pull/592))

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-06

Generated from `v0.8.3..dev` (non-merge commits) and release validation on `dev`.

### Changed
- Bumped package version to `0.8.4`.
- `omx setup` now refreshes managed OMX artifacts by default while preserving backups of overwritten files where applicable.

### Added
- Setup refresh coverage for managed artifact replacement, scope-aware updates, and uninstall compatibility paths.

### Fixed
- Setup now prompts before upgrading managed Codex model references from `gpt-5.3-codex` to `gpt-5.5`, reducing surprise config churn during refreshes.
- Config generation and setup refresh flows are more idempotent and resilient across repeated runs and scoped installs.

### Docs
- Refreshed setup guidance in the README to document the new refresh/upgrade behavior.

### CI / Test
- Hardened the notify-fallback watcher streaming test to wait for watcher shutdown before temp-directory cleanup during full-suite runs.
- Removed an unused setup overwrite prompt code path caught by the `check:no-unused` release gate.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-06

Generated from the Gemini worker hotfix on `dev`, plus release-validation hardening and verification on `dev`.

### Changed
- Bumped package version to `0.8.3`.

### Fixed
- Team runtime now seeds Gemini workers with a prompt-interactive launch (`--approval-mode yolo -i <inbox prompt>`) instead of relying on stdin-only startup behavior (`#585`).
- Gemini workers now drop non-Gemini default model passthroughs unless an explicit Gemini model was requested, preventing invalid mixed-provider startup args (`#585`).
- Expanded runtime and tmux-session coverage for Gemini prompt-mode worker startup and argument translation (`#585`).

### CI / Test
- Hardened the notify-fallback watcher streaming test to wait for watcher readiness before asserting EOF-tail behavior during full-suite runs.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-06

Generated from `v0.8.1..main` (non-merge commits) and release validation on `main`.

### Added
- Gemini CLI worker support for OMX team mode, including mixed CLI maps and `--model` passthrough (`#576`, `#579`, related issue `#573`).
- Default frontier-model fallback is now centralized through `DEFAULT_FRONTIER_MODEL` (currently `gpt-5.5`) instead of hardcoded references (`#583`).
- `configure-notifications` is now the canonical shipped notification-setup skill, with catalog/setup behavior aligned to match docs (`#584`).

### Changed
- Bumped package version to `0.8.2`.
- Setup/install now follows the catalog manifest more strictly and `--force` cleans stale shipped / legacy notification skill directories (`#575`, `#580`, `#584`, closes `#574`).
- Expanded OpenClaw integration docs and localized navigation links (`#571`).

### Fixed
- `omx setup` now skips writing the deprecated `[tui]` section for Codex CLI `>= 0.107.0` (`#572`, fixes `#564`).
- Prevented unresolved placeholder leakage in OpenClaw hook instruction templates (`#581`, closes `#578`).
- Hardened explicit multi-skill ordering and blocked implicit keyword auto-activation for direct `/prompts:<name>` invocations (`#582`).

### Docs
- Aligned notification skill inventory/docs with the canonical `configure-notifications` model and improved prior release-note readability.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-05

Generated from `4141fd6..HEAD` (non-merge commits) and release validation on `dev`.

### Added
- Team CLI interop API (`omx team api ...`) with hard deprecation of legacy `team_*` MCP tools.
- Finalized CLI-first team interop/dispatch reliability flow.

### Changed
- Bumped package version to `0.8.1`.
- Refactored notification setup into a unified `configure-notifications` flow.
- Updated docs to prefer the CLI-first team protocol + interop contract.

### Fixed

### Added
- New canonical provider advisor command: `omx ask <claude|gemini> "<prompt>"`.
- Ouroboros-inspired ambiguity-gated deep interview workflow (`$deep-interview`) for requirement clarification.
- Required pre-context intake gates for execution-heavy flows (autopilot, ralph, team, ralplan, and deep-interview preflight).
- New `$web-clone` skill for URL-driven website cloning and verification loops.
- Built-in `ask-claude` and `ask-gemini` skills in the catalog.
- Visual-verdict feedback loop support for visual Ralph iterations.

### Changed
- Bumped package version to `0.8.0`.
- `ask-claude` and `ask-gemini` skill guidance now routes to canonical `omx ask ...` usage.
- Ask docs/CLI parsing now explicitly align with provider help flags (`claude --print|-p`, `gemini --prompt|-p`).
- Legacy wrapper/npm script entrypoints remain available as transitional compatibility paths with migration hints.
- Refactored team state facade into bounded modules and extracted canonical state-root resolution.
- Improved CLI behavior around `omx ralph --prd`, `--version` routing, and PRD-focused help guidance.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-26

Hotfix: team shutdown `--force` flag was not being parsed from CLI arguments.

### Fixed
- Team shutdown `--force` flag now correctly parsed from CLI args instead of being hardcoded to `false` (`src/cli/team.ts`).
- Added `shutdown_gate_forced` audit event when force-bypass is used, closing an observability gap in the event log.

### Changed
- Updated usage string to document `[--force]` option: `omx team shutdown <team-name> [--force]`.
- Added `shutdown_gate_forced` to `TeamEventType` union and `TEAM_EVENT_TYPES` constant.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-26

4 files changed. Team dispatch reliability improvements — state-first routing with hook-preferred fallback.

### Changed
- Team dispatch rewritten to be state-first and hook-preferred, improving reliability when leader pane targeting varies (#379).
- Leader mailbox delivery uses hook-preferred dispatch path for consistent message routing (#378).

### Fixed
- Leader fallback parity guarded to only target real pane destinations, preventing dispatch to stale or missing panes (#379).
- Hook dispatch reliability paths hardened with additional error guards and fallback sequencing (#378).

- Direct coverage for key production modules (#321, #324).
- Dedicated hooks coverage for extensibility dispatcher and loader (#316).

### Changed

- Tmux hook engine type declarations synced with runtime exports (#313, #328).

### Fixed
- **CI**: Resolved typecheck (6 unused imports) and 7 test failures — HUD NaN/future timestamp handling, state mode validation, slack config `deepStrictEqual`, keyword template-registry sync.
- **Team**: Deterministic prompt worker teardown (#349). Verification protocol wired into runtime completion gates (#298, #351). False prompt-mode resume readiness prevented (#352). Shutdown continues when resize hook unregister fails (#302, #347). Team path guards for explicit state root.
- **Ralph**: Exclusive lock checks fail on malformed state (#357). Lifecycle invariants enforced in direct state writers (#296, #353).
- **Notifications**: Reply config validates and honors enabled channels (#281, #287). Notifier HTTP status and timeout checks enforced (#286). Slack config omits `mention` property when undefined.

- **Setup**: Skill overwrite skipped unless `--force` (#275).
- **Code Intelligence**: AST-grep rewrites applied when `dryRun=false` (#295, #358).
- **Code Simplifier**: Untracked files included in selection (#308). CI test failures from `trim()` and `homedir()` resolved.

- **Trace**: Memory usage on large JSONL histories fixed (#336).
- **Tmux**: Hook indices clamped to signed 32-bit range (#240, #241). HUD resize noise quieted on macOS. Signed 32-bit hook hash coercion enforced (#265).
- **Misc**: Lifecycle best-effort failure warnings surfaced (#315, #346). Notify-hook cross-worktree tests isolated from inherited team env.

### Security
- MCP `workingDirectory` handling hardened with validation and allowlist policy (#289).
- Path traversal prevention for state and team tool calls with mode allowlist enforcement.
- HUD dynamic text sanitized to prevent terminal escape injection (#271).

### Tests
- 1,472 tests across 308 suites — all passing.
- New test suites: `scaling.test.ts`, `task-size-detector.test.ts`, `session.test.ts`, `consensus-execution-handoff.test.ts`, `notify-hook-worker-idle.test.ts`, `template-engine.test.ts`, `hook-config.test.ts`, `idle-cooldown.test.ts`, `reply-config.test.ts`, `path-traversal.test.ts`, `memory-server.test.ts`, `memory-validation.test.ts`, `bootstrap.test.ts`, `code-intel-server.test.ts`, `openclaw/*.test.ts`, `star-prompt.test.ts`, `setup-agents-overwrite.test.ts`, `setup-skills-overwrite.test.ts`, `error-handling-warnings.test.ts`, `catalog-contract.test.ts`.
- Code-simplifier hook coverage made deterministic (#311, #348).
- Ralph persistence gate verification matrix in CI.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Team Claude worker startup now explicitly launches with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, preventing interactive permission prompts during tmux team runs.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for the worker CLI override path to ensure Claude launch args are translated correctly and Codex-only flags are not forwarded.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Client-attached HUD reconcile hook for detached-launch initial pane layout reconciliation.

### Fixed
- Hardened detached session resize hook flow to prevent race conditions when tmux windows drift.
- Hardened HUD/team resize reconciliation for consistent pane organization across attach/detach cycles.
- Reduced HUD delayed reconcile fallback from 10s to 2s for faster layout correction.
- Client-attached hook is now tracked and properly unregistered during rollback.

### Tests
- Added tmux session and CLI sequencing tests for resize/reconcile paths.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Team Claude worker launch now uses plain `claude` with no injected launch args, so local `settings.json` remains authoritative.
- Team startup resolution logging is now Claude-aware: Claude paths report `model=claude source=local-settings` and omit `thinking_level`.

### Changed
- Clarified docs for Team worker CLI behavior in README and `skills/team/SKILL.md` to reflect plain-Claude launch semantics.
- Added regression coverage to preserve Codex reasoning behavior while enforcing Claude no-args launch behavior.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Added a new "What's New in 0.6.0" section to the docs site homepage with highlights for mixed Codex/Claude teammates and reliability updates.

### Changed
- Clarified `skills/team/SKILL.md` docs that `N:agent-type` selects worker role prompts (not CLI choice), and documented `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI` / `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP` usage for launching Claude teammates.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Mixed team worker CLI routing via `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP` so a single `$team` run can launch Codex and Claude workers together (e.g. `codex,codex,claude,claude`).
- Leader-side all-workers-idle nudge fallback for Claude teams, so leader notifications still fire even when worker-side Codex hooks are unavailable.
- Adaptive trigger submit retry guard helper and tests to reduce false-positive resend escalation.

### Changed
- Team trigger fallback now uses a safer ready-prompt + non-active-task gate before adaptive resend.
- Adaptive retry fallback behavior now uses clear-line + resend instead of interrupt escalation in auto mode.

### Fixed
- Pre-assigned worker tasks can now be claimed by their assigned owner in `pending` state, unblocking Codex worker bootstrap claim flow.
- `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP` parsing now rejects empty entries and reports map-specific validation errors.
- `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP=auto` now resolves from launch args/model detection and no longer inherits `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI` overrides unexpectedly.
- Team leader nudge targeting now prioritizes `leader_pane_id`, improving reliability with mixed/Claude worker setups.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Native worktree orchestration for team mode**: Workers now launch in git worktrees with canonical state-root metadata, enabling true isolation for parallel team workstreams.
- **Cross-worktree team state resolution**: MCP state tools and the notify hook resolve team state across worktrees, so the leader always sees the correct shared state regardless of which worktree a worker is running in.
- **`omx ralph` CLI subcommand**: `omx ralph "<task>"` starts a ralph persistence loop directly from the command line, removing the need to manually invoke the skill inside a session (closes #153).
- **Scoped ralph state with canonical persistence migration**: Ralph state is now scoped per session/worktree and migrated from legacy flat paths to the canonical `.omx/state/sessions/` layout automatically.
- **Claim-safe team transition tool for MCP interop**: New `team_transition_task` MCP tool applies state transitions atomically with claim-token verification, preventing race conditions between concurrent workers.
- **Clean tmux pane output before notifications**: Notification content is sanitized (ANSI escapes, tmux artifacts stripped) before being sent to notification integrations, eliminating garbled messages.
- **Startup codebase map injection hook**: Session start injects a lightweight file-tree snapshot into the agent context so workers have structural awareness of the project without extra exploration turns (closes #136).

### Changed
- **`notify-hook.js` refactored into layered sub-modules**: The monolithic hook script is split into focused modules (event routing, tmux integration, notification dispatch) for maintainability and easier extension (closes #177).
- **`ralplan` defaults to non-interactive consensus mode**: The planning loop no longer pauses for interactive prompts by default; pass `--interactive` to restore the prompt-gated flow (closes #144).
- **Removed `/research` skill**: The `$research` skill has been fully removed. Use `$scientist` for data/analysis tasks or `$external-context` for web searches (closes #148).

### Fixed

#### Security
- **Command injection in `capturePaneContent`** prevented by switching from string shell interpolation to a safe argument array (closes #156).
- **Command injection in notifier** fixed by replacing `exec` string interpolation with `execFile` + args array (closes #157).
- **Stale/reused PID risk in reply-listener**: The process-kill path now verifies process identity before sending signals, preventing an unrelated process from being killed if a PID is recycled (closes #158).
- **Path traversal in MCP state/team tool identifiers**: Tool inputs are validated and normalized to prevent `../` escapes from reaching the filesystem (closes #159).
- **Untracked files excluded from codebase map** to prevent accidental filename leakage of unintended files into agent context.

#### Team / Claim Lifecycle
- Claim lease expiry enforced in task transition and release flows — expired claims are rejected before any state mutation (closes #176).
- Duplicate `task_completed` events from `monitorTeam` eliminated; events are deduplicated at the source (closes #161).
- `claimTask` returns `task_not_found` (not a generic error) for missing task IDs, improving worker error handling (closes #167).
- Claims on already-completed or already-failed tasks are rejected upfront (closes #160).
- Ghost worker IDs (workers that no longer exist) are rejected in `claimTask` (closes #179).
- Terminal → non-terminal status regressions in `transitionTaskStatus` are blocked; once a task reaches `completed`/`failed`, its status cannot be unwound.
- In-progress claim takeover prevented when `expected_version` is omitted from the request (closes #173).
- `releaseTaskClaim` no longer reopens a terminal task — release on a completed/failed task is a no-op (closes #174).
- `task_failed` event is now emitted instead of the misleading `worker_stopped` event on task failure (closes #171).
- `team_update_task` rejects lifecycle field mutations (`status`, `claimed_by`) that arrive without a valid claim token (closes #172).
- `updateTask` payload validation added to prevent partial/corrupted task objects from being persisted (closes #163).
- `team_leader_nudge` added to the `team_append_event` MCP schema enum so the nudge event passes schema validation (closes #175).
- Canonical session names used consistently in `getTeamTmuxSessions` (closes #170).

#### Worktree / CLI
- `--worktree <name>` space-separated argument form is now consumed correctly; previously the branch name was silently dropped (closes #203).
- Orphan `--model` flag dropped from worker argv to prevent duplicate flags causing Codex CLI parse errors (closes #162).
- `spawnSync` sleep replaced with `Atomics.wait` so timing delays work reliably even when the `sleep` binary is absent (closes #164).

#### Hooks / tmux
- Copy-mode scroll and clipboard copy re-enabled in `xhigh`/`madmax` tmux sessions (closes #206).
- Thin orchestrator restored in `notify-hook.js` after refactor inadvertently removed it (closes #205).

#### Dependencies
- `ajv` pinned to `>=8.18.0` and `hono` to `>=4.11.10` via npm `overrides` to resolve transitive vulnerability advisories.

### Performance
- `listTasks` file reads parallelized with `Promise.all`, reducing task-list latency for teams with many tasks (closes #168).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Consolidated the prompt/skill catalog and hardened team runtime contracts after the mainline merge (PR #137).
- Added setup scope-aware install modes (`user`, `project`) with persisted scope behavior.
- Added spark worker routing via `--spark` / `--madmax-spark` so team workers can use `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` without forcing the leader model.
- Added notifier verbosity levels for CCNotifier output control.

### Changed
- Updated setup and docs references to match the consolidated catalog and current supported prompt/skill surfaces.

### Fixed
- Hardened tmux runtime behavior, including pane targeting and input submission reliability.
- Hardened tmux pane capture input handling (post-review fix).
- Removed stale references to removed `scientist` prompt and `pipeline` skill (post-review fix).

### Removed
- Removed deprecated prompts: `deep-executor`, `scientist`.
- Removed deprecated skills: `deepinit`, `learn-about-omx`, `learner`, `pipeline`, `project-session-manager`, `psm`, `release`, `ultrapilot`, `writer-memory`.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-19

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Added broader auto-nudge stall detection patterns (for example: "next I can", "say go", and "keep driving") with a focused last-lines hot zone.
- Added worker-idle aggregation notifications so team leaders are alerted when all workers are idle/done (with cooldown and event logging).
- Added automatic tmux mouse scrolling for team sessions (opt-out via `OMX_TEAM_MOUSE=0`).

### Fixed
- Fixed worker message submission reliability by adding settle/delay timing before and during submit key rounds.
- Fixed CLI exit behavior by awaiting `main(...)` in `bin/omx.js` so `/exit` terminates cleanly.
- Replaced deprecated `collab` feature references with `multi_agent` across generator logic, docs, and tests.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- Updated planner handoff guidance to use actionable `$ralph` / `$team` commands instead of the removed `/oh-my-codex:start-work` command.
- Updated team skill docs to describe team-scoped `worker-agents.md` composition (no project `AGENTS.md` mutation).

### Fixed

## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Fixed `omx` not launching tmux session when run outside of tmux (regression in 0.3.7).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-15

### Added
