/**
 * MCP-aligned gateway for all team operations.
 *
 * Both the MCP server (state-server.ts) and the runtime (runtime.ts)
 * import from this module instead of state.ts directly.
 * state.ts remains the private persistence layer.
 *
 * Every exported function here corresponds to (or backs) an MCP tool
 * with the same semantic name, ensuring the runtime contract matches
 * the external MCP surface.
