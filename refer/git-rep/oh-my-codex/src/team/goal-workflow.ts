## Scrum / Team Goal Workflow

Objective: ${instruction.objective}

Durable OMX source of truth:
- Existing team task files, task claims, lifecycle events, and leader audit remain the durable artifacts.
- This section is a logical Codex goal handoff only; it does not create separate per-worker goal JSON or leader-audit artifacts.

Source-of-truth rules:
- Existing team task files and claim lifecycle remain authoritative; this worker goal must reference task IDs ${instruction.taskIds.join(", ")} instead of creating a duplicate task list.
- Claim each task with \`omx team api claim-task\` before editing; use the task file claim/status as the current assignment record.
- Record completion evidence through \`omx team api transition-task-status\`; leader audit owns aggregate team completion.

Assigned task/claim references:
${taskLines}

Codex goal handoff guidance (truthful fallback only):
1. If goal tools are available in this worker thread, call \`get_goal\` before creating or completing a goal.
2. Call \`create_goal\` only when no active goal exists and the explicit worker objective above should become this thread's active objective.
3. Do not claim OMX shell commands mutated Codex goal state; shell/team APIs persist only OMX artifacts and task state.
4. Call \`update_goal({status: "complete"})\` only after assigned task transitions are complete and verification evidence is present for leader audit.
