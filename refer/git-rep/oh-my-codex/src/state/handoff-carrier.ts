 * calls this BEFORE normalizing:
 *  - `undefined` and `null` are ABSENCE. Explicit null is ordinary JSON for "no value" and keeps the
 *    advisory path, matching how the gate's own `present()` predicate treats it.
 *  - a non-array object is the only valid supplied shape.
 *  - anything else - array, string, number, boolean - is corruption and throws.

 * would read. Any writer accepting caller input must call this, not the single-value assertion.
 *
 * The recursion deliberately stops at ONE level of `state`, because that is exactly how far
 * `stateField` looks. A value buried deeper - `state.state.handoff_artifacts` - is unreadable by the
 * gate, so it is TREATED AS ABSENT and can never be credited as evidence. That makes it inert stored
 * data rather than an authorization bypass, but it is absence, not a separate third state. If

 * validator ignores` fails and forces this depth to match.
